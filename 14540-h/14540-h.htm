<h1>When William Came</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I: THE SINGING-BIRD AND THE BAROMETER</h2>
<p>Cicely Yeovil sat in a low swing chair, alternately looking at herself
in a mirror and at the other occupant of the room in the flesh.&nbsp;
Both prospects gave her undisguised satisfaction.&nbsp; Without being
vain she was duly appreciative of good looks, whether in herself or
in another, and the reflection that she saw in the mirror, and the young
man whom she saw seated at the piano, would have come with credit out
of a more severely critical inspection.&nbsp; Probably she looked longer
and with greater appreciation at the piano player than at her own image;
her good looks were an inherited possession, that had been with her
more or less all her life, while Ronnie Storre was a comparatively new
acquisition, discovered and achieved, so to speak, by her own enterprise,
selected by her own good taste.&nbsp; Fate had given her adorable eyelashes
and an excellent profile.&nbsp; Ronnie was an indulgence she had bestowed
on herself.</p>
<p>Cicely had long ago planned out for herself a complete philosophy
of life, and had resolutely set to work to carry her philosophy into
practice.&nbsp; &ldquo;When love is over how little of love even the
lover understands,&rdquo; she quoted to herself from one of her favourite
poets, and transposed the saying into &ldquo;While life is with us how
little of life even the materialist understands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most people
that she knew took endless pains and precautions to preserve and prolong
their lives and keep their powers of enjoyment unimpaired; few, very
few, seemed to make any intelligent effort at understanding what they
really wanted in the way of enjoying their lives, or to ascertain what
were the best means for satisfying those wants.&nbsp; Fewer still bent
their whole energies to the one paramount aim of getting what they wanted
in the fullest possible measure.&nbsp; Her scheme of life was not a
wholly selfish one; no one could understand what she wanted as well
as she did herself, therefore she felt that she was the best person
to pursue her own ends and cater for her own wants.&nbsp; To have others
thinking and acting for one merely meant that one had to be perpetually
grateful for a lot of well-meant and usually unsatisfactory services.&nbsp;
It was like the case of a rich man giving a community a free library,
when probably the community only wanted free fishing or reduced tram-fares.&nbsp;
Cicely studied her own whims and wishes, experimented in the best method
of carrying them into effect, compared the accumulated results of her
experiments, and gradually arrived at a very clear idea of what she
wanted in life, and how best to achieve it.&nbsp; She was not by disposition
a self-centred soul, therefore she did not make the mistake of supposing
that one can live successfully and gracefully in a crowded world without
taking due notice of the other human elements around one.&nbsp; She
was instinctively far more thoughtful for others than many a person
who is genuinely but unseeingly addicted to unselfishness.</p>
<p>Also she kept in her armoury the weapon which can be so mightily
effective if used sparingly by a really sincere individual&mdash;the
knowledge of when to be a humbug.&nbsp; Ambition entered to a certain
extent into her life, and governed it perhaps rather more than she knew.&nbsp;
She desired to escape from the doom of being a nonentity, but the escape
would have to be effected in her own way and in her own time; to be
governed by ambition was only a shade or two better than being governed
by convention.</p>
<p>The drawing-room in which she and Ronnie were sitting was of such
proportions that one hardly knew whether it was intended to be one room
or several, and it had the merit of being moderately cool at two o&rsquo;clock
on a particularly hot July afternoon.&nbsp; In the coolest of its many
alcoves servants had noiselessly set out an improvised luncheon table:
a tempting array of caviare, crab and mushroom salads, cold asparagus,
slender hock bottles and high-stemmed wine goblets peeped out from amid
a setting of Charlotte Klemm roses.</p>
<p>Cicely rose from her seat and went over to the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, touching the young man lightly with
a finger-tip on the top of his very sleek, copper-hued head, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
going to have picnic-lunch to-day up here; it&rsquo;s so much cooler
than any of the downstairs rooms, and we shan&rsquo;t be bothered with
the servants trotting in and out all the time.&nbsp; Rather a good idea
of mine, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie, after looking anxiously to see that the word &ldquo;picnic&rdquo;
did not portend tongue sandwiches and biscuits, gave the idea his blessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is young Storre&rsquo;s profession?&rdquo; some one had
once asked concerning him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a great many friends who have independent incomes,&rdquo;
had been the answer.</p>
<p>The meal was begun in an appreciative silence; a picnic in which
three kinds of red pepper were available for the caviare demanded a
certain amount of respectful attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart ought to be like a singing-bird to-day, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Cicely presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your good man is coming home?&rdquo; asked Ronnie.</p>
<p>Cicely nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s expected some time this afternoon, though I&rsquo;m
rather vague as to which train he arrives by.&nbsp; Rather a stifling
day for railway travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>is</i> your heart doing the singing-bird business?&rdquo;
asked Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;if I may choose the
bird.&nbsp; A missel-thrush would do, perhaps; it sings loudest in stormy
weather, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie disposed of two or three stems of asparagus before making
any comment on this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there going to be stormy weather?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The domestic barometer is set rather that way,&rdquo; said
Cicely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Murrey has been away for ever so long,
and, of course, there will be lots of things he won&rsquo;t be used
to, and I&rsquo;m afraid matters may be rather strained and uncomfortable
for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he will object to me?&rdquo; asked Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s quite
broad-minded on most subjects, and he realises that this is an age in
which sensible people know thoroughly well what they want, and are determined
to get what they want.&nbsp; It pleases me to see a lot of you, and
to spoil you and pay you extravagant compliments about your good looks
and your music, and to imagine at times that I&rsquo;m in danger of
getting fond of you; I don&rsquo;t see any harm in it, and I don&rsquo;t
suppose Murrey will either&mdash;in fact, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if he takes rather a liking to you.&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s the general
situation that will trouble and exasperate him; he&rsquo;s not had time
to get accustomed to the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i> like we have.&nbsp;
It will break on him with horrible suddenness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was somewhere in Russia when the war broke out, wasn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; said Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in the wilds of Eastern Siberia, shooting and bird
collecting, miles away from a railway or telegraph line, and it was
all over before he knew anything about it; it didn&rsquo;t last very
long, when you come to think of it.&nbsp; He was due home somewhere
about that time, and when the weeks slipped by without my hearing from
him, I quite thought he&rsquo;d been captured in the Baltic or somewhere
on the way back.&nbsp; It turned out that he was down with marsh fever
in some out-of-the-way spot, and everything was over and finished with
before he got back to civilisation and newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a bit of a shock,&rdquo; said Ronnie, busy
with a well-devised salad; &ldquo;still, I don&rsquo;t see why there
should be domestic storms when he comes back.&nbsp; You are hardly responsible
for the catastrophe that has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll come back naturally
feeling sore and savage with everything he sees around him, and he won&rsquo;t
realise just at once that we&rsquo;ve been through all that ourselves,
and have reached the stage of sullen acquiescence in what can&rsquo;t
be helped.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t understand, for instance, how we can
be enthusiastic and excited over Gorla Mustelford&rsquo;s d&eacute;but,
and things of that sort; he&rsquo;ll think we are a set of callous revellers,
fiddling while Rome is burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case,&rdquo; said Ronnie, &ldquo;Rome isn&rsquo;t
burning, it&rsquo;s burnt.&nbsp; All that remains to be done is to rebuild
it&mdash;when possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, and he&rsquo;ll say we&rsquo;re not doing much towards
helping at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Ronnie, &ldquo;the whole thing has only
just happened; &lsquo;Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day,&rsquo; and we
can&rsquo;t rebuild our Rome in a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;but so many of our friends,
and especially Murrey&rsquo;s friends, have taken the thing in a tragical
fashion, and cleared off to the Colonies, or shut themselves up in their
country houses, as though there was a sort of moral leprosy infecting
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good that does,&rdquo; said Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do any good, but it&rsquo;s what a lot of
them have done because they felt like doing it, and Murrey will feel
like doing it too.&nbsp; That is where I foresee trouble and disagreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would take things tragically if I saw the good of it,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;as matters stand it&rsquo;s too late in the day and
too early to be anything but philosophical about what one can&rsquo;t
help.&nbsp; For the present we&rsquo;ve just got to make the best of
things.&nbsp; Besides, you can&rsquo;t very well turn down Gorla at
the last moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to turn down Gorla, or anybody,&rdquo;
said Cicely with decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it would be silly, and
silliness doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.&nbsp; That is why I foresee storms
on the domestic horizon.&nbsp; After all, Gorla has her career to think
of.&nbsp; Do you know,&rdquo; she added, with a change of tone, &ldquo;I
rather wish you would fall in love with Gorla; it would make me horribly
jealous, and a little jealousy is such a good tonic for any woman who
knows how to dress well.&nbsp; Also, Ronnie, it would prove that you
are capable of falling in love with some one, of which I&rsquo;ve grave
doubts up to the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is one of the few things in which the make-believe is
superior to the genuine,&rdquo; said Ronnie, &ldquo;it lasts longer,
and you get more fun out of it, and it&rsquo;s easier to replace when
you&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s rather like playing with coloured paper
instead of playing with fire,&rdquo; objected Cicely.</p>
<p>A footman came round the corner with the trained silence that tactfully
contrives to make itself felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Luton to see you, Madam,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;shall
I say you are in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Luton?&nbsp; Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll
probably have something to tell us about Gorla&rsquo;s concert,&rdquo;
she added, turning to Ronnie.</p>
<p>Tony Luton was a young man who had sprung from the people, and had
taken care that there should be no recoil.&nbsp; He was scarcely twenty
years of age, but a tightly packed chronicle of vicissitudes lay behind
his sprightly insouciant appearance.&nbsp; Since his fifteenth year
he had lived, Heaven knew how, getting sometimes a minor engagement
at some minor music-hall, sometimes a temporary job as secretary-valet-companion
to a roving invalid, dining now and then on plovers&rsquo; eggs and
asparagus at one of the smarter West End restaurants, at other times
devouring a kipper or a sausage in some stuffy Edgware Road eating-house;
always seemingly amused by life, and always amusing.&nbsp; It is possible
that somewhere in such heart as he possessed there lurked a rankling
bitterness against the hard things of life, or a scrap of gratitude
towards the one or two friends who had helped him disinterestedly, but
his most intimate associates could not have guessed at the existence
of such feelings.&nbsp; Tony Luton was just a merry-eyed dancing faun,
whom Fate had surrounded with streets instead of woods, and it would
have been in the highest degree inartistic to have sounded him for a
heart or a heartache.</p>
<p>The dancing of the faun took one day a livelier and more assured
turn, the joyousness became more real, and the worst of the vicissitudes
seemed suddenly over.&nbsp; A musical friend, gifted with mediocre but
marketable abilities, supplied Tony with a song, for which he obtained
a trial performance at an East End hall.&nbsp; Dressed as a jockey,
for no particular reason except that the costume suited him, he sang,
&ldquo;They quaff the gay bubbly in Eccleston Square&rdquo; to an appreciative
audience, which included the manager of a famous West End theatre of
varieties.&nbsp; Tony and his song won the managerial favour, and were
immediately transplanted to the West End house, where they scored a
success of which the drooping music-hall industry was at the moment
badly in need.</p>
<p>It was just after the great catastrophe, and men of the London world
were in no humour to think; they had witnessed the inconceivable befall
them, they had nothing but political ruin to stare at, and they were
anxious to look the other way.&nbsp; The words of Tony&rsquo;s song
were more or less meaningless, though he sang them remarkably well,
but the tune, with its air of slyness and furtive joyousness, appealed
in some unaccountable manner to people who were furtively unhappy, and
who were trying to appear stoically cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must be, must be,&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poor
heart that never rejoices,&rdquo; were the popular expressions of the
London public at that moment, and the men who had to cater for that
public were thankful when they were able to stumble across anything
that fitted in with the prevailing mood.&nbsp; For the first time in
his life Tony Luton discovered that agents and managers were a leisured
class, and that office boys had manners.</p>
<p>He entered Cicely&rsquo;s drawing-room with the air of one to whom
assurance of manner has become a sheathed weapon, a court accessory
rather than a trade implement.&nbsp; He was more quietly dressed than
the usual run of music-hall successes; he had looked critically at life
from too many angles not to know that though clothes cannot make a man
they can certainly damn him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I have lunched already,&rdquo; he said in answer
to a question from Cicely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said again
in a cheerful affirmative, as the question of hock in a tall ice-cold
goblet was propounded to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to tell you the latest about the Gorla Mustelford
evening,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Laurent is putting his
back into it, and it&rsquo;s really going to be rather a big affair.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going to out-Russian the Russians.&nbsp; Of course, she
hasn&rsquo;t their technique nor a tenth of their training, but she&rsquo;s
having tons of advertisement.&nbsp; The name Gorla is almost an advertisement
in itself, and then there&rsquo;s the fact that she&rsquo;s the daughter
of a peer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has temperament,&rdquo; said Cicely, with the decision
of one who makes a vague statement in a good cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Laurent says,&rdquo; observed Tony.&nbsp; &ldquo;He discovers
temperament in every one that he intends to boom.&nbsp; He told me that
I had temperament to the finger-tips, and I was too polite to contradict
him.&nbsp; But I haven&rsquo;t told you the really important thing about
the Mustelford d&eacute;but.&nbsp; It is a profound secret, more or
less, so you must promise not to breathe a word about it till half-past
four, when it will appear in all the six o&rsquo;clock newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tony paused for dramatic effect, while he drained his goblet, and
then made his announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Majesty is going to be present.&nbsp; Informally and unofficially,
but still present in the flesh.&nbsp; A sort of casual dropping in,
carefully heralded by unconfirmed rumour a week ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Cicely, in genuine excitement, &ldquo;what
a bold stroke.&nbsp; Lady Shalem has worked that, I bet.&nbsp; I suppose
it will go down all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust Laurent to see to that,&rdquo; said Tony, &ldquo;he
knows how to fill his house with the right sort of people, and he&rsquo;s
not the one to risk a fiasco.&nbsp; He knows what he&rsquo;s about.&nbsp;
I tell you, it&rsquo;s going to be a big evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Ronnie suddenly, &ldquo;give a supper
party here for Gorla on the night, and ask the Shalem woman and all
her crowd.&nbsp; It will be awful fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely caught at the suggestion with some enthusiasm.&nbsp; She did
not particularly care for Lady Shalem, but she thought it would be just
as well to care for her as far as outward appearances went.</p>
<p>Grace, Lady Shalem, was a woman who had blossomed into sudden importance
by constituting herself a sort of foster-mother to the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&nbsp;
At a moment when London was denuded of most of its aforetime social
leaders she had seen her opportunity, and made the most of it.&nbsp;
She had not contented herself with bowing to the inevitable, she had
stretched out her hand to it, and forced herself to smile graciously
at it, and her polite attentions had been reciprocated.&nbsp; Lady Shalem,
without being a beauty or a wit, or a grand lady in the traditional
sense of the word, was in a fair way to becoming a power in the land;
others, more capable and with stronger claims to social recognition,
would doubtless overshadow her and displace her in due course, but for
the moment she was a person whose good graces counted for something,
and Cicely was quite alive to the advantage of being in those good graces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be rather fun,&rdquo; she said, running over in her
mind the possibilities of the suggested supper-party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be jolly useful,&rdquo; put in Ronnie eagerly; &ldquo;you
could get all sorts of interesting people together, and it would be
an excellent advertisement for Gorla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie approved of supper-parties on principle, but he was also thinking
of the advantage which might accrue to the drawing-room concert which
Cicely had projected (with himself as the chief performer), if he could
be brought into contact with a wider circle of music patrons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it would be useful,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;it would
be almost historical; there&rsquo;s no knowing who might not come to
it&mdash;and things are dreadfully slack in the entertaining line just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ambitious note in her character was making itself felt at that
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the library, and work out a list of
people to invite,&rdquo; said Ronnie.</p>
<p>A servant entered the room and made a brief announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Yeovil has arrived, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother,&rdquo; said Ronnie sulkily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll
cool off about that supper party, and turn down Gorla and the rest of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly true that the supper already seemed a more difficult
proposition in Cicely&rsquo;s eyes than it had a moment or two ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not forget my only daughter,<br />
E&rsquo;en though Saphia has crossed the sea,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>quoted Tony, with mocking laughter in his voice and eyes.</p>
<p>Cicely went down to greet her husband.&nbsp; She felt that she was
probably very glad that he was home once more; she was angry with herself
for not feeling greater certainty on the point.&nbsp; Even the well-beloved,
however, can select the wrong moment for return.&nbsp; If Cicely Yeovil&rsquo;s
heart was like a singing-bird, it was of a kind that has frequent lapses
into silence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II: THE HOMECOMING</h2>
<p>Murrey Yeovil got out of the boat-train at Victoria Station, and
stood waiting, in an attitude something between listlessness and impatience,
while a porter dragged his light travelling kit out of the railway carriage
and went in search of his heavier baggage with a hand-truck.&nbsp; Yeovil
was a grey-faced young man, with restless eyes, and a rather wistful
mouth, and an air of lassitude that was evidently only a temporary characteristic.&nbsp;
The hot dusty station, with its blended crowds of dawdling and scurrying
people, its little streams of suburban passengers pouring out every
now and then from this or that platform, like ants swarming across a
garden path, made a wearisome climax to what had been a rather wearisome
journey.&nbsp; Yeovil glanced quickly, almost furtively, around him
in all directions, with the air of a man who is constrained by morbid
curiosity to look for things that he would rather not see.&nbsp; The
announcements placed in German alternatively with English over the booking
office, left-luggage office, refreshment buffets, and so forth, the
crowned eagle and monogram displayed on the post boxes, caught his eye
in quick succession.</p>
<p>He turned to help the porter to shepherd his belongings on to the
truck, and followed him to the outer yard of the station, where a string
of taxi-cabs was being slowly absorbed by an outpouring crowd of travellers.</p>
<p>Portmanteaux, wraps, and a trunk or two, much be-labelled and travel-worn,
were stowed into a taxi, and Yeovil turned to give the direction to
the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight, Berkshire Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Berkschirestrasse, acht-und-zwanzig,&rdquo; echoed the man,
a bulky spectacled individual of unmistakable Teuton type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight, Berkshire Street,&rdquo; repeated Yeovil, and
got into the cab, leaving the driver to re-translate the direction into
his own language.</p>
<p>A succession of cabs leaving the station blocked the roadway for
a moment or two, and Yeovil had leisure to observe the fact that Viktoria
Strasse was lettered side by side with the familiar English name of
the street.&nbsp; A notice directing the public to the neighbouring
swimming baths was also written up in both languages.&nbsp; London had
become a bi-lingual city, even as Warsaw.</p>
<p>The cab threaded its way swiftly along Buckingham Palace Road towards
the Mall.&nbsp; As they passed the long front of the Palace the traveller
turned his head resolutely away, that he might not see the alien uniforms
at the gates and the eagle standard flapping in the sunlight.&nbsp;
The taxi driver, who seemed to have combative instincts, slowed down
as he was turning into the Mall, and pointed to the white pile of memorial
statuary in front of the palace gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grossmutter Denkmal, yes,&rdquo; he announced, and resumed
his journey.</p>
<p>Arrived at his destination, Yeovil stood on the steps of his house
and pressed the bell with an odd sense of forlornness, as though he
were a stranger drifting from nowhere into a land that had no cognisance
of him; a moment later he was standing in his own hall, the object of
respectful solicitude and attention.&nbsp; Sprucely garbed and groomed
lackeys busied themselves with his battered travel-soiled baggage; the
door closed on the guttural-voiced taxi driver, and the glaring July
sunshine.&nbsp; The wearisome journey was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear, how dreadfully pulled-down you look,&rdquo; said
Cicely, when the first greetings had been exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a slow business, getting well,&rdquo; said
Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only three-quarter way there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at his reflection in a mirror and laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen what I looked like five or six weeks
ago,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have let me come out and nurse you,&rdquo; said
Cicely; &ldquo;you know I wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they nursed me well enough,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;and
it would have been a shame dragging you out there; a small Finnish health
resort, out of the season, is not a very amusing place, and it would
have been worse for any one who didn&rsquo;t talk Russian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been buried alive there,&rdquo; said Cicely,
with commiseration in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to be buried alive,&rdquo; said Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
news from the outer world was not of a kind that helped a despondent
invalid towards convalescence.&nbsp; They spoke to me as little as possible
about what was happening, and I was grateful for your letters because
they also told me very little.&nbsp; When one is abroad, among foreigners,
one&rsquo;s country&rsquo;s misfortunes cause one an acuter, more personal
distress, than they would at home even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are at home now, anyway,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;and
you can jog along the road to complete recovery at your own pace.&nbsp;
A little quiet shooting this autumn and a little hunting, just enough
to keep you fit and not to overtire you; you mustn&rsquo;t overtax your
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting my strength back all right,&rdquo; said
Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;This journey hasn&rsquo;t tired me half as much
as one might have expected.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the awful drag of listlessness,
mental and physical, that is the worst after-effect of these marsh fevers;
they drain the energy out of you in bucketfuls, and it trickles back
again in teaspoonfuls.&nbsp; And just now untiring energy is what I
shall need, even more than strength; I don&rsquo;t want to degenerate
into a slacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Murrey,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;after we&rsquo;ve
had dinner together to-night, I&rsquo;m going to do a seemingly unwifely
thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to go out and leave you alone with an old
friend.&nbsp; Doctor Holham is coming in to drink coffee and smoke with
you.&nbsp; I arranged this because I knew it was what you would like.&nbsp;
Men can talk these things over best by themselves, and Holham can tell
you everything that happened&mdash;since you went away.&nbsp; It will
be a dreary story, I&rsquo;m afraid, but you will want to hear it all.&nbsp;
It was a nightmare time, but now one sees it in a calmer perspective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel in a nightmare still,&rdquo; said Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all felt like that,&rdquo; said Cicely, rather with the
air of an elder person who tells a child that it will understand things
better when it grows up; &ldquo;time is always something of a narcotic
you know.&nbsp; Things seem absolutely unbearable, and then bit by bit
we find out that we are bearing them.&nbsp; And now, dear, I&rsquo;ll
fill up your notification paper and leave you to superintend your unpacking.&nbsp;
Robert will give you any help you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the notification paper?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a stupid form to be filled up when any one arrives, to
say where they come from, and their business and nationality and religion,
and all that sort of thing.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re rather more bureaucratic
than we used to be, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil said nothing, but into the sallow greyness of his face there
crept a dark flush, that faded presently and left his colour more grey
and bloodless than before.</p>
<p>The journey seemed suddenly to have recommenced; he was under his
own roof, his servants were waiting on him, his familiar possessions
were in evidence around him, but the sense of being at home had vanished.&nbsp;
It was as though he had arrived at some wayside hotel, and been asked
to register his name and status and destination.&nbsp; Other things
of disgust and irritation he had foreseen in the London he was coming
to&mdash;the alterations on stamps and coinage, the intrusive Teuton
element, the alien uniforms cropping up everywhere, the new orientation
of social life; such things he was prepared for, but this personal evidence
of his subject state came on him unawares, at a moment when he had,
so to speak, laid his armour aside.&nbsp; Cicely spoke lightly of the
hateful formality that had been forced on them; would he, too, come
to regard things in the same acquiescent spirit?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III: &ldquo;THE METSKIE TSAR&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the early stages of my fever when I got the first
inkling of what was going on,&rdquo; said Yeovil to the doctor, as they
sat over their coffee in a recess of the big smoking-room; &ldquo;just
able to potter about a bit in the daytime, fighting against depression
and inertia, feverish as evening came on, and delirious in the night.&nbsp;
My game tracker and my attendant were both Buriats, and spoke very little
Russian, and that was the only language we had in common to converse
in.&nbsp; In matters concerning food and sport we soon got to understand
each other, but on other subjects we were not easily able to exchange
ideas.&nbsp; One day my tracker had been to a distant trading-store
to get some things of which we were in need; the store was eighty miles
from the nearest point of railroad, eighty miles of terribly bad roads,
but it was in its way a centre and transmitter of news from the outside
world.&nbsp; The tracker brought back with him vague tidings of a conflict
of some sort between the &lsquo;Metskie Tsar&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Angliskie
Tsar,&rsquo; and kept repeating the Russian word for defeat.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Angliskie Tsar&rsquo; I recognised, of course, as the King of
England, but my brain was too sick and dull to read any further meaning
into the man&rsquo;s reiterated gabble.&nbsp; I grew so ill just then
that I had to give up the struggle against fever, and make my way as
best I could towards the nearest point where nursing and doctoring could
be had.&nbsp; It was one evening, in a lonely rest-hut on the edge of
a huge forest, as I was waiting for my boy to bring the meal for which
I was feverishly impatient, and which I knew I should loathe as soon
as it was brought, that the explanation of the word &lsquo;Metskie&rsquo;
flashed on me.&nbsp; I had thought of it as referring to some Oriental
potentate, some rebellious rajah perhaps, who was giving trouble, and
whose followers had possibly discomfited an isolated British force in
some out-of-the-way corner of our Empire.&nbsp; And all of a sudden
I knew that &lsquo;Nemetskie Tsar,&rsquo; German Emperor, had been the
name that the man had been trying to convey to me.&nbsp; I shouted for
the tracker, and put him through a breathless cross-examination; he
confirmed what my fears had told me.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Metskie Tsar&rsquo;
was a big European ruler, he had been in conflict with the &lsquo;Angliskie
Tsar,&rsquo; and the latter had been defeated, swept away; the man spoke
the word that he used for ships, and made energetic pantomime to express
the sinking of a fleet.&nbsp; Holham, there was nothing for it but to
hope that this was a false, groundless rumour, that had somehow crept
to the confines of civilisation.&nbsp; In my saner balanced moments
it was possible to disbelieve it, but if you have ever suffered from
delirium you will know what raging torments of agony I went through
in the nights, how my brain fought and refought that rumoured disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor gave a murmur of sympathetic understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Yeovil, &ldquo;I reached the small
Siberian town towards which I had been struggling.&nbsp; There was a
little colony of Russians there, traders, officials, a doctor or two,
and some army officers.&nbsp; I put up at the primitive hotel-restaurant,
which was the general gathering-place of the community.&nbsp; I knew
quickly that the news was true.&nbsp; Russians are the most tactful
of any European race that I have ever met; they did not stare with insolent
or pitying curiosity, but there was something changed in their attitude
which told me that the travelling Briton was no longer in their eyes
the interesting respect-commanding personality that he had been in past
days.&nbsp; I went to my own room, where the samovar was bubbling its
familiar tune and a smiling red-shirted Russian boy was helping my Buriat
servant to unpack my wardrobe, and I asked for any back numbers of newspapers
that could be supplied at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; I was given
a bundle of well-thumbed sheets, odd pieces of the <i>Novoe</i> <i>Vremya</i>,
the <i>Moskovskie</i> <i>Viedomosti</i>, one or two complete numbers
of local papers published at Perm and Tobolsk.&nbsp; I do not read Russian
well, though I speak it fairly readily, but from the fragments of disconnected
telegrams that I pieced together I gathered enough information to acquaint
me with the extent of the tragedy that had been worked out in a few
crowded hours in a corner of North-Western Europe.&nbsp; I searched
frantically for telegrams of later dates that would put a better complexion
on the matter, that would retrieve something from the ruin; presently
I came across a page of the illustrated supplement that the <i>Novoe</i>
<i>Vremya</i> publishes once a week.&nbsp; There was a photograph of
a long-fronted building with a flag flying over it, labelled &lsquo;The
new standard floating over Buckingham Palace.&rsquo;&nbsp; The picture
was not much more than a smudge, but the flag, possibly touched up,
was unmistakable.&nbsp; It was the eagle of the Nemetskie Tsar.&nbsp;
I have a vivid recollection of that plainly-furnished little room, with
the inevitable gilt ikon in one corner, and the samovar hissing and
gurgling on the table, and the thrumming music of a balalaika orchestra
coming up from the restaurant below; the next coherent thing I can remember
was weeks and weeks later, discussing in an impersonal detached manner
whether I was strong enough to stand the fatigue of the long railway
journey to Finland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, Holham, I have been encouraged to keep my mind
as much off the war and public affairs as possible, and I have been
glad to do so.&nbsp; I knew the worst and there was no particular use
in deepening my despondency by dragging out the details.&nbsp; But now
I am more or less a live man again, and I want to fill in the gaps in
my knowledge of what happened.&nbsp; You know how much I know, and how
little; those fragments of Russian newspapers were about all the information
that I had.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know clearly how the whole thing
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil settled himself back in his chair with the air of a man who
has done some necessary talking, and now assumes the r&ocirc;le of listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It started,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;with a wholly unimportant
disagreement about some frontier business in East Africa; there was
a slight attack of nerves in the stock markets, and then the whole thing
seemed in a fair way towards being settled.&nbsp; Then the negotiations
over the affair began to drag unduly, and there was a further flutter
of nervousness in the money world.&nbsp; And then one morning the papers
reported a highly menacing speech by one of the German Ministers, and
the situation began to look black indeed.&nbsp; &lsquo;He will be disavowed,&rsquo;
every one said over here, but in less than twenty-four hours those who
knew anything knew that the crisis was on us&mdash;only their knowledge
came too late.&nbsp; &lsquo;War between two such civilised and enlightened
nations is an impossibility,&rsquo; one of our leaders of public opinion
had declared on the Saturday; by the following Friday the war had indeed
become an impossibility, because we could no longer carry it on.&nbsp;
It burst on us with calculated suddenness, and we were just not enough,
everywhere where the pressure came.&nbsp; Our ships were good against
their ships, our seamen were better than their seamen, but our ships
were not able to cope with their ships plus their superiority in aircraft.&nbsp;
Our trained men were good against their trained men, but they could
not be in several places at once, and the enemy could.&nbsp; Our half-trained
men and our untrained men could not master the science of war at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, and a moment&rsquo;s notice was all they got.&nbsp; The enemy
were a nation apprenticed in arms, we were not even the idle apprentice:
we had not deemed apprenticeship worth our while.&nbsp; There was courage
enough running loose in the land, but it was like unharnessed electricity,
it controlled no forces, it struck no blows.&nbsp; There was no time
for the heroism and the devotion which a drawn-out struggle, however
hopeless, can produce; the war was over almost as soon as it had begun.&nbsp;
After the reverses which happened with lightning rapidity in the first
three days of warfare, the newspapers made no effort to pretend that
the situation could be retrieved; editors and public alike recognised
that these were blows over the heart, and that it was a matter of moments
before we were counted out.&nbsp; One might liken the whole affair to
a snap checkmate early in a game of chess; one side had thought out
the moves, and brought the requisite pieces into play, the other side
was hampered and helpless, with its resources unavailable, its strategy
discounted in advance.&nbsp; That, in a nutshell, is the history of
the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil was silent for a moment or two, then he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sequel, the peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collapse was so complete that I fancy even the enemy were
hardly prepared for the consequences of their victory.&nbsp; No one
had quite realised what one disastrous campaign would mean for an island
nation with a closely packed population.&nbsp; The conquerors were in
a position to dictate what terms they pleased, and it was not wonderful
that their ideas of aggrandisement expanded in the hour of intoxication.&nbsp;
There was no European combination ready to say them nay, and certainly
no one Power was going to be rash enough to step in to contest the terms
of the treaty that they imposed on the conquered.&nbsp; Annexation had
probably never been a dream before the war; after the war it suddenly
became temptingly practical.&nbsp; <i>Warum</i> <i>nicht</i>? became
the theme of leader-writers in the German press; they pointed out that
Britain, defeated and humiliated, but with enormous powers of recuperation,
would be a dangerous and inevitable enemy for the Germany of to-morrow,
while Britain incorporated within the Hohenzollern Empire would merely
be a disaffected province, without a navy to make its disaffection a
serious menace, and with great tax-paying capabilities, which would
be available for relieving the burdens of the other Imperial States.&nbsp;
Wherefore, why not annex?&nbsp; The <i>warum</i> <i>nicht</i>? party
prevailed.&nbsp; Our King, as you know, retired with his Court to Delhi,
as Emperor in the East, with most of his overseas dominions still subject
to his sway.&nbsp; The British Isles came under the German Crown as
a <i>Reichsland</i>, a sort of Alsace-Lorraine washed by the North Sea
instead of the Rhine.&nbsp; We still retain our Parliament, but it is
a clipped and pruned-down shadow of its former self, with most of its
functions in abeyance; when the elections were held it was difficult
to get decent candidates to come forward or to get people to vote.&nbsp;
It makes one smile bitterly to think that a year or two ago we were
seriously squabbling as to who should have votes.&nbsp; And, of course,
the old party divisions have more or less crumbled away.&nbsp; The Liberals
naturally are under the blackest of clouds, for having steered the country
to disaster, though to do them justice it was no more their fault than
the fault of any other party.&nbsp; In a democracy such as ours was
the Government of the day must more or less reflect the ideas and temperament
of the nation in all vital matters, and the British nation in those
days could not have been persuaded of the urgent need for military apprenticeship
or of the deadly nature of its danger.&nbsp; It was willing now and
then to be half-frightened and to have half-measures, or, one might
better say, quarter-measures taken to reassure it, and the governments
of the day were willing to take them, but any political party or group
of statesmen that had said &lsquo;the danger is enormous and immediate,
the sacrifices and burdens must be enormous and immediate,&rsquo; would
have met with certain defeat at the polls.&nbsp; Still, of course, the
Liberals, as the party that had held office for nearly a decade, incurred
the odium of a people maddened by defeat and humiliation; one Minister,
who had had less responsibility for military organisation than perhaps
any of them, was attacked and nearly killed at Newcastle, another was
hiding for three days on Exmoor, and escaped in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Conservatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are also under eclipse, but it is more or less voluntary
in their case.&nbsp; For generations they had taken their stand as supporters
of Throne and Constitution, and when they suddenly found the Constitution
gone and the Throne filled by an alien dynasty, their political orientation
had vanished.&nbsp; They are in much the same position as the Jacobites
occupied after the Hanoverian accession.&nbsp; Many of the leading Tory
families have emigrated to the British lands beyond the seas, others
are shut up in their country houses, retrenching their expenses, selling
their acres, and investing their money abroad.&nbsp; The Labour faction,
again, are almost in as bad odour as the Liberals, because of having
hob-nobbed too effusively and ostentatiously with the German democratic
parties on the eve of the war, exploiting an evangel of universal brotherhood
which did not blunt a single Teuton bayonet when the hour came.&nbsp;
I suppose in time party divisions will reassert themselves in some form
or other; there will be a Socialist Party, and the mercantile and manufacturing
interests will evolve a sort of bourgeoise party, and the different
religious bodies will try to get themselves represented&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil made a movement of impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these things that you forecast,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;must
take time, considerable time; is this nightmare, then, to go on for
ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a nightmare, unfortunately,&rdquo; said the doctor,
&ldquo;it is a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely&mdash;a nation such as ours, a virile, highly-civilised
nation with an age-long tradition of mastery behind it, cannot be held
under for ever by a few thousand bayonets and machine guns.&nbsp; We
must surely rise up one day and drive them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear man,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;we might, of course,
at some given moment overpower the garrison that is maintained here,
and seize the forts, and perhaps we might be able to mine the harbours;
what then?&nbsp; In a fortnight or so we could be starved into unconditional
submission.&nbsp; Remember, all the advantages of isolated position
that told in our favour while we had the sea dominion, tell against
us now that the sea dominion is in other hands.&nbsp; The enemy would
not need to mobilise a single army corps or to bring a single battleship
into action; a fleet of nimble cruisers and destroyers circling round
our coasts would be sufficient to shut out our food supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to tell me that this is a final overthrow?&rdquo;
said Yeovil in a shaking voice; &ldquo;are we to remain a subject race
like the Poles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope for a better fate,&rdquo; said the doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our opportunity may come if the Master Power is ever involved
in an unsuccessful naval war with some other nation, or perhaps in some
time of European crisis, when everything hung in the balance, our latent
hostility might have to be squared by a concession of independence.&nbsp;
That is what we have to hope for and watch for.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the conquerors have to count on time and tact to weaken and finally
obliterate the old feelings of nationality; the middle-aged of to-day
will grow old and acquiescent in the changed state of things; the young
generations will grow up never having known anything different.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a far cry to Delhi, as the old Indian proverb says, and the
strange half-European, half-Asiatic Court out there will seem more and
more a thing exotic and unreal.&nbsp; &lsquo;The King across the water&rsquo;
was a rallying-cry once upon a time in our history, but a king on the
further side of the Indian Ocean is a shadowy competitor for one who
alternates between Potsdam and Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me everything,&rdquo; said Yeovil, after
another pause; &ldquo;tell me, Holham, how far has this obliterating
process of &lsquo;time and tact&rsquo; gone?&nbsp; It seems to be pretty
fairly started already.&nbsp; I bought a newspaper as soon as I landed,
and I read it in the train coming up.&nbsp; I read things that puzzled
and disgusted me.&nbsp; There were announcements of concerts and plays
and first-nights and private views; there were even small dances.&nbsp;
There were advertisements of house-boats and week-end cottages and string
bands for garden parties.&nbsp; It struck me that it was rather like
merrymaking with a dead body lying in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeovil,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you must bear in mind
two things.&nbsp; First, the necessity for the life of the country going
on as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; It is true that many thousands
of our working men and women have emigrated and thousands of our upper
and middle class too; they were the people who were not tied down by
business, or who could afford to cut those ties.&nbsp; But those represent
comparatively a few out of the many.&nbsp; The great businesses and
the small businesses must go on, people must be fed and clothed and
housed and medically treated, and their thousand-and-one wants and necessities
supplied.&nbsp; Look at me, for instance; however much I loathe coming
under a foreign domination and paying taxes to an alien government,
I can&rsquo;t abandon my practice and my patients, and set up anew in
Toronto or Allahabad, and if I could, some other doctor would have to
take my place here.&nbsp; I or that other doctor must have our servants
and motors and food and furniture and newspapers, even our sport.&nbsp;
The golf links and the hunting field have been well-nigh deserted since
the war, but they are beginning to get back their votaries because out-door
sport has become a necessity, and a very rational necessity, with numbers
of men who have to work otherwise under unnatural and exacting conditions.&nbsp;
That is one factor of the situation.&nbsp; The other affects London
more especially, but through London it influences the rest of the country
to a certain extent.&nbsp; You will see around you here much that will
strike you as indications of heartless indifference to the calamity
that has befallen our nation.&nbsp; Well, you must remember that many
things in modern life, especially in the big cities, are not national
but international.&nbsp; In the world of music and art and the drama,
for instance, the foreign names are legion, they confront you at every
turn, and some of our British devotees of such arts are more acclimatised
to the ways of Munich or Moscow than they are familiar with the life,
say, of Stirling or York.&nbsp; For years they have lived and thought
and spoken in an atmosphere and jargon of denationalised culture&mdash;even
those of them who have never left our shores.&nbsp; They would take
pains to be intimately familiar with the domestic affairs and views
of life of some Galician gipsy dramatist, and gravely quote and discuss
his opinions on debts and mistresses and cookery, while they would shudder
at &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye ken John Peel?&rsquo; as a piece of uncouth barbarity.&nbsp;
You cannot expect a world of that sort to be permanently concerned or
downcast because the Crown of Charlemagne takes its place now on the
top of the Royal box in the theatres, or at the head of programmes at
State concerts.&nbsp; And then there are the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many in the land, or at least in London,&rdquo;
said Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are even more of them now than there used to be,&rdquo;
said Holham.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am to a great extent a disliker of Jews
myself, but I will be fair to them, and admit that those of them who
were in any genuine sense British have remained British and have stuck
by us loyally in our misfortune; all honour to them.&nbsp; But of the
others, the men who by temperament and everything else were far more
Teuton or Polish or Latin than they were British, it was not to be expected
that they would be heartbroken because London had suddenly lost its
place among the political capitals of the world, and became a cosmopolitan
city.&nbsp; They had appreciated the free and easy liberty of the old
days, under British rule, but there was a stiff insularity in the ruling
race that they chafed against.&nbsp; Now, putting aside some petty Government
restrictions that Teutonic bureaucracy has brought in, there is really,
in their eyes, more licence and social adaptability in London than before.&nbsp;
It has taken on some of the aspects of a No-Man&rsquo;s-Land, and the
Jew, if he likes, may almost consider himself as of the dominant race;
at any rate he is ubiquitous.&nbsp; Pleasure, of the caf&eacute; and
cabaret and boulevard kind, the sort of thing that gave Berlin the aspect
of the gayest capital in Europe within the last decade, that is the
insidious leaven that will help to denationalise London.&nbsp; Berlin
will probably climb back to some of its old austerity and simplicity,
a world-ruling city with a great sense of its position and its responsibilities,
while London will become more and more the centre of what these people
understand by life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil made a movement of impatience and disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said the doctor, sympathetically; &ldquo;life
and enjoyment mean to you the howl of a wolf in a forest, the call of
a wild swan on the frozen tundras, the smell of a wood fire in some
little inn among the mountains.&nbsp; There is more music to you in
the quick thud, thud of hoofs on desert mud as a free-stepping horse
is led up to your tent door than in all the dronings and flourishes
that a highly-paid orchestra can reel out to an expensively fed audience.&nbsp;
But the tastes of modern London, as we see them crystallised around
us, lie in a very different direction.&nbsp; People of the world that
I am speaking of, our dominant world at the present moment, herd together
as closely packed to the square yard as possible, doing nothing worth
doing, and saying nothing worth saying, but doing it and saying it over
and over again, listening to the same melodies, watching the same artistes,
echoing the same catchwords, ordering the same dishes in the same restaurants,
suffering each other&rsquo;s cigarette smoke and perfumes and conversation,
feverishly, anxiously making arrangements to meet each other again to-morrow,
next week, and the week after next, and repeat the same gregarious experience.&nbsp;
If they were not herded together in a corner of western London, watching
each other with restless intelligent eyes, they would be herded together
at Brighton or Dieppe, doing the same thing.&nbsp; Well, you will find
that life of that sort goes forward just as usual, only it is even more
prominent and noticeable now because there is less public life of other
kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil said something which was possibly the Buriat word for the
nether world.&nbsp; Outside in the neighbouring square a band had been
playing at intervals during the evening.&nbsp; Now it struck up an air
that Yeovil had already heard whistled several times since his landing,
an air with a captivating suggestion of slyness and furtive joyousness
running through it.</p>
<p>He rose and walked across to the window, opening it a little wider.&nbsp;
He listened till the last notes had died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that tune they have just played?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear it often enough,&rdquo; said the doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A Frenchman writing in the <i>Matin</i> the other day called
it the &lsquo;National Anthem of the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV: &ldquo;ES IST VERBOTEN&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Yeovil wakened next morning to the pleasant sensation of being in
a household where elaborate machinery for the smooth achievement of
one&rsquo;s daily life was noiselessly and unceasingly at work.&nbsp;
Fever and the long weariness of convalescence in indifferently comfortable
surroundings had given luxury a new value in his eyes.&nbsp; Money had
not always been plentiful with him in his younger days; in his twenty-eighth
year he had inherited a fairly substantial fortune, and he had married
a wealthy woman a few months later.&nbsp; It was characteristic of the
man and his breed that the chief use to which he had put his newly-acquired
wealth had been in seizing the opportunity which it gave him for indulging
in unlimited travel in wild, out-of-the-way regions, where the comforts
of life were meagrely represented.&nbsp; Cicely occasionally accompanied
him to the threshold of his expeditions, such as Cairo or St. Petersburg
or Constantinople, but her own tastes in the matter of roving were more
or less condensed within an area that comprised Cannes, Homburg, the
Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian Fiords.&nbsp; Things outlandish
and barbaric appealed to her chiefly when presented under artistic but
highly civilised stage management on the boards of Covent Garden, and
if she wanted to look at wolves or sand grouse, she preferred doing
so in the company of an intelligent Fellow of the Zoological Society
on some fine Sunday afternoon in Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; It was one
of the bonds of union and good-fellowship between her husband and herself
that each understood and sympathised with the other&rsquo;s tastes without
in the least wanting to share them; they went their own ways and were
pleased and comrade-like when the ways happened to run together for
a span, without self-reproach or heart-searching when the ways diverged.&nbsp;
Moreover, they had separate and adequate banking accounts, which constitute,
if not the keys of the matrimonial Heaven, at least the oil that lubricates
them.</p>
<p>Yeovil found Cicely and breakfast waiting for him in the cool breakfast-room,
and enjoyed, with the appreciation of a recent invalid, the comfort
and resources of a meal that had not to be ordered or thought about
in advance, but seemed as though it were there, fore-ordained from the
beginning of time in its smallest detail.&nbsp; Each desire of the breakfasting
mind seemed to have its realisation in some dish, lurking unobtrusively
in hidden corners until asked for.&nbsp; Did one want grilled mushrooms,
English fashion, they were there, black and moist and sizzling, and
extremely edible; did one desire mushrooms <i>&agrave;</i> <i>la</i>
<i>Russe</i>, they appeared, blanched and cool and toothsome under their
white blanketing of sauce.&nbsp; At one&rsquo;s bidding was a service
of coffee, prepared with rather more forethought and circumspection
than would go to the preparation of a revolution in a South American
Republic.</p>
<p>The exotic blooms that reigned in profusion over the other parts
of the house were scrupulously banished from the breakfast-room; bowls
of wild thyme and other flowering weeds of the meadow and hedgerow gave
it an atmosphere of country freshness that was in keeping with the morning
meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look dreadfully tired still,&rdquo; said Cicely critically,
&ldquo;otherwise I would recommend a ride in the Park, before it gets
too hot.&nbsp; There is a new cob in the stable that you will just love,
but he is rather lively, and you had better content yourself for the
present with some more sedate exercise than he is likely to give you.&nbsp;
He is apt to try and jump out of his skin when the flies tease him.&nbsp;
The Park is rather jolly for a walk just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that will be about my form after my long journey,&rdquo;
said Yeovil, &ldquo;an hour&rsquo;s stroll before lunch under the trees.&nbsp;
That ought not to fatigue me unduly.&nbsp; In the afternoon I&rsquo;ll
look up one or two people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count on finding too many of your old set,&rdquo;
said Cicely rather hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare say some of them will
find their way back some time, but at present there&rsquo;s been rather
an exodus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bredes,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;are they here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the Bredes are in Scotland, at their place in Sutherlandshire;
they don&rsquo;t come south now, and the Ricardes are farming somewhere
in East Africa, the whole lot of them.&nbsp; Valham has got an appointment
of some sort in the Straits Settlement, and has taken his family with
him.&nbsp; The Collards are down at their mother&rsquo;s place in Norfolk;
a German banker has bought their house in Manchester Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Hebways?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Hebway is in India,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;but his
mother lives in Paris; poor Hugo, you know, was killed in the war.&nbsp;
My friends the Allinsons are in Paris too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rather a
clearance, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; However, there are some left, and I
expect others will come back in time.&nbsp; Pitherby is here; he&rsquo;s
one of those who are trying to make the best of things under the new
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be,&rdquo; said Yeovil, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult question,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;whether
one should stay at home and face the music or go away and live a transplanted
life under the British flag.&nbsp; Either attitude might be dictated
by patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one thing to face the music, it is another thing to
dance to it,&rdquo; said Yeovil.</p>
<p>Cicely poured out some more coffee for herself and changed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in to lunch, I suppose?&nbsp; The Clubs are
not very attractive just now, I believe, and the restaurants are mostly
hot in the middle of the day.&nbsp; Ronnie Storre is coming in; he&rsquo;s
here pretty often these days.&nbsp; A rather good-looking young animal
with something mid-way between talent and genius in the piano-playing
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long-haired and Semetic or Tcheque or anything of that
sort, I suppose?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>Cicely laughed at the vision of Ronnie conjured up by her husband&rsquo;s
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, beautifully groomed and clipped and Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp;
I expect you&rsquo;ll like him.&nbsp; He plays bridge almost as well
as he plays the piano.&nbsp; I suppose you wonder at any one who can
play bridge well wanting to play the piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite so intolerant as all that,&rdquo; said
Yeovil; &ldquo;anyhow I promise to like Ronnie.&nbsp; Is any one else
coming to lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan Mardle will probably drop in, in fact I&rsquo;m afraid
she&rsquo;s a certainty.&nbsp; She invited herself in that way of hers
that brooks of no refusal.&nbsp; On the other hand, as a mitigating
circumstance, there will be a <i>point</i> <i>d&rsquo;asperge</i> omelette
such as few kitchens could turn out, so don&rsquo;t be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil set out for his morning walk with the curious sensation of
one who starts on a voyage of discovery in a land that is well known
to him.&nbsp; He turned into the Park at Hyde Park corner and made his
way along the familiar paths and alleys that bordered the Row.&nbsp;
The familiarity vanished when he left the region of fenced-in lawns
and rhododendron bushes and came to the open space that stretched away
beyond the bandstand.&nbsp; The bandstand was still there, and a military
band, in sky-blue Saxon uniform, was executing the first item in the
forenoon programme of music.&nbsp; Around it, instead of the serried
rows of green chairs that Yeovil remembered, was spread out an acre
or so of small round tables, most of which had their quota of customers,
engaged in a steady consumption of lager beer, coffee, lemonade and
syrups.&nbsp; Further in the background, but well within earshot of
the band, a gaily painted pagoda-restaurant sheltered a number of more
commodious tables under its awnings, and gave a hint of convenient indoor
accommodation for wet or windy weather.&nbsp; Movable screens of trellis-trained
foliage and climbing roses formed little hedges by means of which any
particular table could be shut off from its neighbours if semi-privacy
were desired.&nbsp; One or two decorative advertisements of popularised
brands of champagne and Rhine wines adorned the outside walls of the
building, and under the central gable of its upper story was a flamboyant
portrait of a stern-faced man, whose image and superscription might
also be found on the newer coinage of the land.&nbsp; A mass of bunting
hung in folds round the flag-pole on the gable, and blew out now and
then on a favouring breeze, a long three-coloured strip, black, white,
and scarlet, and over the whole scene the elm trees towered with an
absurd sardonic air of nothing having changed around their roots.</p>
<p>Yeovil stood for a minute or two, taking in every detail of the unfamiliar
spectacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have certainly accomplished something that we never attempted,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself.&nbsp; Then he turned on his heel and made his
way back to the shady walk that ran alongside the Row.&nbsp; At first
sight little was changed in the aspect of the well-known exercising
ground.&nbsp; One or two riding masters cantered up and down as of yore,
with their attendant broods of anxious-faced young girls and awkwardly
bumping women pupils, while horsey-looking men put marketable animals
through their paces or drew up to the rails for long conversations with
horsey-looking friends on foot.&nbsp; Sportingly attired young women,
sitting astride of their horses, careered by at intervals as though
an extremely game fox were leading hounds a merry chase a short way
ahead of them; it all seemed much as usual.</p>
<p>Presently, from the middle distance a bright patch of colour set
in a whirl of dust drew rapidly nearer and resolved itself into a group
of cavalry officers extending their chargers in a smart gallop.&nbsp;
They were well mounted and sat their horses to perfection, and they
made a brave show as they raced past Yeovil with a clink and clatter
and rhythmic thud, thud, of hoofs, and became once more a patch of colour
in a whirl of dust.&nbsp; An answering glow of colour seemed to have
burned itself into the grey face of the young man, who had seen them
pass without appearing to look at them, a stinging rush of blood, accompanied
by a choking catch in the throat and a hot white blindness across the
eyes.&nbsp; The weakness of fever broke down at times the rampart of
outward indifference that a man of Yeovil&rsquo;s temperament builds
coldly round his heartstrings.</p>
<p>The Row and its riders had become suddenly detestable to the wanderer;
he would not run the risk of seeing that insolently joyous cavalcade
come galloping past again.&nbsp; Beyond a narrow stretch of tree-shaded
grass lay the placid sunlit water of the Serpentine, and Yeovil made
a short cut across the turf to reach its gravelled bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you read either English or German?&rdquo; asked
a policeman who confronted him as he stepped off the turf.</p>
<p>Yeovil stared at the man and then turned to look at the small neatly-printed
notice to which the official was imperiously pointing; in two languages
it was made known that it was forbidden and <i>verboten</i>, punishable
and <i>straffbar</i>, to walk on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three shilling fine,&rdquo; said the policeman, extending
his hand for the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I pay you?&rdquo; asked Yeovil, feeling almost inclined
to laugh; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather a stranger to the new order of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pay me,&rdquo; said the policeman, &ldquo;and you receive
a quittance for the sum paid,&rdquo; and he proceeded to tear a counterfoil
receipt for a three shilling fine from a small pocket book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said Yeovil, as he handed over the sum demanded
and received his quittance, &ldquo;what the red and white band on your
sleeve stands for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bi-lingual,&rdquo; said the constable, with an air of importance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Preference is given to members of the Force who qualify in both
languages.&nbsp; Nearly all the police engaged on Park duty are bi-lingual.&nbsp;
About as many foreigners as English use the parks nowadays; in fact,
on a fine Sunday afternoon, you&rsquo;ll find three foreigners to every
two English.&nbsp; The park habit is more Continental than British,
I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are there many Germans in the police Force?&rdquo; asked
Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, a good few; there had to be,&rdquo; said the constable;
&ldquo;there were such a lot of resignations when the change came, and
they had to be filled up somehow.&nbsp; Lots of men what used to be
in the Force emigrated or found work of some other kind, but everybody
couldn&rsquo;t take that line; wives and children had to be thought
of.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t every head of a family that can chuck
up a job on the chance of finding another.&nbsp; Starvation&rsquo;s
been the lot of a good many what went out.&nbsp; Those of us that stayed
on got better pay than we did before, but then of course the duties
are much more multitudinous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be,&rdquo; said Yeovil, fingering his three shilling
State document; &ldquo;by the way,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;are all the
grass plots in the Park out of bounds for human feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere where you see the notices,&rdquo; said the policeman,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s about three-fourths of the whole grass space;
there&rsquo;s been a lot of new gravel walks opened up in all directions.&nbsp;
People don&rsquo;t want to walk on the grass when they&rsquo;ve got
clean paths to walk on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this parting reproof the bi-lingual constable strode heavily
away, his loss of consideration and self-esteem as a unit of a sometime
ruling race evidently compensated for to some extent by his enhanced
importance as an official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women and children,&rdquo; thought Yeovil, as he looked
after the retreating figure; &ldquo;yes, that is one side of the problem.&nbsp;
The children that have to be fed and schooled, the women folk that have
to be cared for, an old mother, perhaps, in the home that cannot be
broken up.&nbsp; The old case of giving hostages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed the path alongside the Serpentine, passing under the
archway of the bridge and continuing his walk into Kensington Gardens.&nbsp;
In another moment he was within view of the Peter Pan statue and at
once observed that it had companions.&nbsp; On one side was a group
representing a scene from one of the Grimm fairy stories, on the other
was Alice in conversation with Gryphon and Mockturtle, the episode looking
distressingly stiff and meaningless in its sculptured form.&nbsp; Two
other spaces had been cleared in the neighbouring turf, evidently for
the reception of further statue groups, which Yeovil mentally assigned
to Struwelpeter and Little Lord Fauntleroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;German middle-class taste,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;but
in this matter we certainly gave them a lead.&nbsp; I suppose the idea
is that childish fancy is dead and that it is only decent to erect some
sort of memorial to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was growing hotter, and the Park had ceased to seem a desirable
place to loiter in.&nbsp; Yeovil turned his steps homeward, passing
on his way the bandstand with its surrounding acreage of tables.&nbsp;
It was now nearly one o&rsquo;clock, and luncheon parties were beginning
to assemble under the awnings of the restaurant.&nbsp; Lighter refreshments,
in the shape of sausages and potato salads, were being carried out by
scurrying waiters to the drinkers of lager beer at the small tables.&nbsp;
A park orchestra, in brilliant trappings, had taken the place of the
military band.&nbsp; As Yeovil passed the musicians launched out into
the tune which the doctor had truly predicted he would hear to repletion
before he had been many days in London; the &ldquo;National Anthem of
the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V: L&rsquo;ART D&rsquo;ETRE COUSINE</h2>
<p>Joan Mardle had reached forty in the leisurely untroubled fashion
of a woman who intends to be comely and attractive at fifty.&nbsp; She
cultivated a jovial, almost joyous manner, with a top-dressing of hearty
good will and good nature which disarmed strangers and recent acquaintances;
on getting to know her better they hastily re-armed themselves.&nbsp;
Some one had once aptly described her as a hedgehog with the protective
mimicry of a puffball.&nbsp; If there was an awkward remark to be made
at an inconvenient moment before undesired listeners, Joan invariably
made it, and when the occasion did not present itself she was usually
capable of creating it.&nbsp; She was not without a certain popularity,
the sort of popularity that a dashing highwayman sometimes achieved
among those who were not in the habit of travelling on his particular
highway.&nbsp; A great-aunt on her mother&rsquo;s side of the family
had married so often that Joan imagined herself justified in claiming
cousin-ship with a large circle of disconnected houses, and treating
them all on a relationship footing, which theoretical kinship enabled
her to exact luncheons and other accommodations under the plea of keeping
the lamp of family life aglow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt I simply had to come to-day,&rdquo; she chuckled at
Yeovil; &ldquo;I was just dying to see the returned traveller.&nbsp;
Of course, I know perfectly well that neither of you want me, when you
haven&rsquo;t seen each other for so long and must have heaps and heaps
to say to one another, but I thought I would risk the odium of being
the third person on an occasion when two are company and three are a
nuisance.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it brave of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in full knowledge of the fact that the luncheon party would
not in any case have been restricted to Yeovil and his wife, having
seen Ronnie arrive in the hall as she was being shown upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie Storre is coming, I believe,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;so
you&rsquo;re not breaking into a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie, oh I don&rsquo;t count him,&rdquo; said Joan gaily;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s just a boy who looks nice and eats asparagus.&nbsp;
I hear he&rsquo;s getting to play the piano really well.&nbsp; Such
a pity.&nbsp; He will grow fat; musicians always do, and it will ruin
him.&nbsp; I speak feelingly because I&rsquo;m gravitating towards plumpness
myself.&nbsp; The Divine Architect turns us out fearfully and wonderfully
built, and the result is charming to the eye, and then He adds another
chin and two or three extra inches round the waist, and the effect is
ruined.&nbsp; Fortunately you can always find another Ronnie when this
one grows fat and uninteresting; the supply of boys who look nice and
eat asparagus is unlimited.&nbsp; Hullo, Mr. Storre, we were all talking
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very damaging, I hope?&rdquo; said Ronnie, who had
just entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we were merely deciding that, whatever you may do with
your life, your chin must remain single.&nbsp; When one&rsquo;s chin
begins to lead a double life one&rsquo;s own opportunities for depravity
are insensibly narrowed.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t tell me that you haven&rsquo;t
any hankerings after depravity; people with your coloured eyes and hair
are always depraved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce you to my husband, Ronnie,&rdquo; said Cicely,
&ldquo;and then let&rsquo;s go and begin lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two must almost feel as if you were honeymooning again,&rdquo;
said Joan as they sat down; &ldquo;you must have quite forgotten each
other&rsquo;s tastes and peculiarities since you last met.&nbsp; Old
Emily Fronding was talking about you yesterday, when I mentioned that
Murrey was expected home; &lsquo;curious sort of marriage tie,&rsquo;
she said, in that stupid staring way of hers, &lsquo;when husband and
wife spend most of their time in different continents.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
call it marriage at all.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s the best way of doing things.&nbsp; The Yeovils will
be a united and devoted couple long after heaps of their married contemporaries
have trundled through the Divorce Court.&rsquo;&nbsp; I forgot at the
moment that her youngest girl had divorced her husband last year, and
that her second girl is rumoured to be contemplating a similar step.&nbsp;
One can&rsquo;t remember everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan Mardle was remarkable for being able to remember the smallest
details in the family lives of two or three hundred acquaintances.</p>
<p>From personal matters she went with a bound to the political small
talk of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Official Declaration as to the House of Lords is out at
last,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I bought a paper just before coming here,
but I left it in the Tube.&nbsp; All existing titles are to lapse if
three successive holders, including the present ones, fail to take the
oath of allegiance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any taken it up to the present?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only about nineteen, so far, and none of them representing
very leading families; of course others will come in gradually, as the
change of Dynasty becomes more and more an accepted fact, and of course
there will be lots of new creations to fill up the gaps.&nbsp; I hear
for certain that Pitherby is to get a title of some sort, in recognition
of his literary labours.&nbsp; He has written a short history of the
House of Hohenzollern, for use in schools you know, and he&rsquo;s bringing
out a popular Life of Frederick the Great&mdash;at least he hopes it
will be popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that writing was much in his line,&rdquo;
said Yeovil, &ldquo;beyond the occasional editing of a company prospectus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand his historical researches have given every satisfaction
in exalted quarters,&rdquo; said Joan; &ldquo;something may be lacking
in the style, perhaps, but the august approval can make good that defect
with the style of Baron.&nbsp; Pitherby has such a kind heart; &lsquo;kind
hearts are more than coronets,&rsquo; we all know, but the two go quite
well together.&nbsp; And the dear man is not content with his services
to literature, he&rsquo;s blossoming forth as a liberal patron of the
arts.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s taken quite a lot of tickets for dear Gorla&rsquo;s
d&eacute;but; half the second row of the dress-circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Gorla Mustelford?&rdquo; asked Yeovil, catching
at the name; &ldquo;what on earth is she having a d&eacute;but about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Joan, in loud-voiced amazement; &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t
you heard?&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t Cicely told you?&nbsp; How funny that
you shouldn&rsquo;t have heard.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s going to be one
of the events of the season.&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s talking about it.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going to do suggestion dancing at the Caravansery Theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, what is suggestion dancing?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, something quite new,&rdquo; explained Joan; &ldquo;at
any rate the name is quite new and Gorla is new as far as the public
are concerned, and that is enough to establish the novelty of the thing.&nbsp;
Among other things she does a dance suggesting the life of a fern; I
saw one of the rehearsals, and to me it would have equally well suggested
the life of John Wesley.&nbsp; However, that is probably the fault of
my imagination&mdash;I&rsquo;ve either got too much or too little.&nbsp;
Anyhow it is an understood thing that she is to take London by storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I last saw Gorla Mustelford,&rdquo; observed Yeovil,
&ldquo;she was a rather serious flapper who thought the world was in
urgent need of regeneration and was not certain whether she would regenerate
it or take up miniature painting.&nbsp; I forget which she attempted
ultimately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is quite serious about her art,&rdquo; put in Cicely;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s studied a good deal abroad and worked hard at mastering
the technique of her profession.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not a mere amateur
with a hankering after the footlights.&nbsp; I fancy she will do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do her people say about it?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re simply furious about it,&rdquo; answered
Joan; &ldquo;the idea of a daughter of the house of Mustelford prancing
and twisting about the stage for Prussian officers and Hamburg Jews
to gaze at is a dreadful cup of humiliation for them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
unfortunate, of course, that they should feel so acutely about it, but
still one can understand their point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what other point of view they could possibly
take,&rdquo; said Yeovil sharply; &ldquo;if Gorla thinks that the necessities
of art, or her own inclinations, demand that she should dance in public,
why can&rsquo;t she do it in Paris or even Vienna?&nbsp; Anywhere would
be better, one would think, than in London under present conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had given Joan the indication that she was looking for as to his
attitude towards the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&nbsp; Without asking
a question she had discovered that husband and wife were divided on
the fundamental issue that underlay all others at the present moment.&nbsp;
Cicely was weaving social schemes for the future, Yeovil had come home
in a frame of mind that threatened the destruction of those schemes,
or at any rate a serious hindrance to their execution.&nbsp; The situation
presented itself to Joan&rsquo;s mind with an alluring piquancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are giving a grand supper-party for Gorla on the night
of her d&eacute;but, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked Cicely; &ldquo;several
people spoke to me about it, so I suppose it must be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tony Luton and young Storre had taken care to spread the news of
the projected supper function, in order to ensure against a change of
plans on Cicely&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorla is a great friend of mine,&rdquo; said Cicely, trying
to talk as if the conversation had taken a perfectly indifferent turn;
&ldquo;also I think she deserves a little encouragement after the hard
work she has been through.&nbsp; I thought it would be doing her a kindness
to arrange a supper party for her on her first night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.&nbsp; Yeovil said nothing, and
Joan understood the value of being occasionally tongue-tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole question is,&rdquo; continued Cicely, as the silence
became oppressive, &ldquo;whether one is to mope and hold aloof from
the national life, or take our share in it; the life has got to go on
whether we participate in it or not.&nbsp; It seems to me to be more
patriotic to come down into the dust of the marketplace than to withdraw
oneself behind walls or beyond the seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the industrial life of the country has to go on,&rdquo;
said Yeovil; &ldquo;no one could criticise Gorla if she interested herself
in organising cottage industries or anything of that sort, in which
she would be helping her own people.&nbsp; That one could understand,
but I don&rsquo;t think a cosmopolitan concern like the music-hall business
calls for personal sacrifices from young women of good family at a moment
like the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just at a moment like the present that the people want
something to interest them and take them out of themselves,&rdquo; said
Cicely argumentatively; &ldquo;what has happened, has happened, and
we can&rsquo;t undo it or escape the consequences.&nbsp; What we can
do, or attempt to do, is to make things less dreary, and make people
less unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a word, more contented,&rdquo; said Yeovil; &ldquo;if I
were a German statesman, that is the end I would labour for and encourage
others to labour for, to make the people forget that they were discontented.&nbsp;
All this work of regalvanising the social side of London life may be
summed up in the phrase &lsquo;<i>travailler</i> <i>pour</i> <i>le</i>
<i>roi</i> <i>de</i> <i>Prusse</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is any use in discussing the matter
further,&rdquo; said Cicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that grand supper-party not coming off,&rdquo; said
Joan provocatively.</p>
<p>Ronnie looked anxiously at Cicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see it coming on, if you&rsquo;re gifted with prophetic
vision of a reliable kind,&rdquo; said Cicely; &ldquo;of course as Murrey
doesn&rsquo;t take kindly to the idea of Gorla&rsquo;s enterprise I
won&rsquo;t have the party here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it at a restaurant,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I can see Murrey&rsquo;s point of view, and
sympathise with it, but I&rsquo;m not going to throw Gorla over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause of uncomfortably protracted duration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, this is a top-hole omelette,&rdquo; said Ronnie.</p>
<p>It was his only contribution to the conversation, but it was a valuable
one.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI: HERR VON KWARL</h2>
<p>Herr Von Kwarl sat at his favourite table in the Brandenburg Caf&eacute;,
the new building that made such an imposing show (and did such thriving
business) at the lower end of what most of its patrons called the Regentstrasse.&nbsp;
Though the establishment was new it had already achieved its unwritten
code of customs, and the sanctity of Herr von Kwarl&rsquo;s specially
reserved table had acquired the authority of a tradition.&nbsp; A set
of chessmen, a copy of the <i>Kreuz</i> <i>Zeitung</i> and the <i>Times</i>,
and a slim-necked bottle of Rhenish wine, ice-cool from the cellar,
were always to be found there early in the forenoon, and the honoured
guest for whom these preparations were made usually arrived on the scene
shortly after eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; For an hour or so he would
read and silently digest the contents of his two newspapers, and then
at the first sign of flagging interest on his part, another of the caf&eacute;&rsquo;s
regular customers would march across the floor, exchange a word or two
on the affairs of the day, and be bidden with a wave of the hand into
the opposite seat.&nbsp; A waiter would instantly place the chessboard
with its marshalled ranks of combatants in the required position, and
the contest would begin.</p>
<p>Herr von Kwarl was a heavily built man of mature middle-age, of the
blond North-German type, with a facial aspect that suggested stupidity
and brutality.&nbsp; The stupidity of his mien masked an ability and
shrewdness that was distinctly above the average, and the suggestion
of brutality was belied by the fact that von Kwarl was as kind-hearted
a man as one could meet with in a day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; Early in
life, almost before he was in his teens, Fritz von Kwarl had made up
his mind to accept the world as it was, and to that philosophical resolution,
steadfastly adhered to, he attributed his excellent digestion and his
unruffled happiness.&nbsp; Perhaps he confused cause and effect; the
excellent digestion may have been responsible for at least some of the
philosophical serenity.</p>
<p>He was a bachelor of the type that is called confirmed, and which
might better be labelled consecrated; from his early youth onward to
his present age he had never had the faintest flickering intention of
marriage.&nbsp; Children and animals he adored, women and plants he
accounted somewhat of a nuisance.&nbsp; A world without women and roses
and asparagus would, he admitted, be robbed of much of its charm, but
with all their charm these things were tiresome and thorny and capricious,
always wanting to climb or creep in places where they were not wanted,
and resolutely drooping and fading away when they were desired to flourish.&nbsp;
Animals, on the other hand, accepted the world as it was and made the
best of it, and children, at least nice children, uncontaminated by
grown-up influences, lived in worlds of their own making.</p>
<p>Von Kwarl held no acknowledged official position in the country of
his residence, but it was an open secret that those responsible for
the real direction of affairs sought his counsel on nearly every step
that they meditated, and that his counsel was very rarely disregarded.&nbsp;
Some of the shrewdest and most successful enactments of the ruling power
were believed to have originated in the brain-cells of the bovine-fronted
<i>Stammgast</i> of the Brandenburg Caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>Around the wood-panelled walls of the Caf&eacute; were set at intervals
well-mounted heads of boar, elk, stag, roe-buck, and other game-beasts
of a northern forest, while in between were carved armorial escutcheons
of the principal cities of the lately expanded realm, Magdeburg, Manchester,
Hamburg, Bremen, Bristol, and so forth.&nbsp; Below these came shelves
on which stood a wonderful array of stone beer-mugs, each decorated
with some fantastic device or motto, and most of them pertaining individually
and sacredly to some regular and unfailing customer.&nbsp; In one particular
corner of the highest shelf, greatly at his ease and in nowise to be
disturbed, slept Wotan, the huge grey house-cat, dreaming doubtless
of certain nimble and audacious mice down in the cellar three floors
below, whose nimbleness and audacity were as precious to him as the
forwardness of the birds is to a skilled gun on a grouse moor.&nbsp;
Once every day Wotan came marching in stately fashion across the polished
floor, halted mid-way to resume an unfinished toilet operation, and
then proceeded to pay his leisurely respects to his friend von Kwarl.&nbsp;
The latter was said to be prouder of this daily demonstration of esteem
than of his many coveted orders of merit.&nbsp; Several of his friends
and acquaintances shared with him the distinction of having achieved
the Black Eagle, but not one of them had ever succeeded in obtaining
the slightest recognition of their existence from Wotan.</p>
<p>The daily greeting had been exchanged and the proud grey beast had
marched away to the music of a slumberous purr.&nbsp; The <i>Kreuz</i>
<i>Zeitung</i> and the <i>Times</i> underwent a final scrutiny and were
pushed aside, and von Kwarl glanced aimlessly out at the July sunshine
bathing the walls and windows of the Piccadilly Hotel.&nbsp; Herr Rebinok,
the plump little Pomeranian banker, stepped across the floor, almost
as noiselessly as Wotan had done, though with considerably less grace,
and some half-minute later was engaged in sliding pawns and knights
and bishops to and fro on the chess-board in a series of lightning moves
bewildering to look on.&nbsp; Neither he nor his opponent played with
the skill that they severally brought to bear on banking and statecraft,
nor did they conduct their game with the politeness that they punctiliously
observed in other affairs of life.&nbsp; A running fire of contemptuous
remarks and aggressive satire accompanied each move, and the mere record
of the conversation would have given an uninitiated onlooker the puzzling
impression that an easy and crushing victory was assured to both the
players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, he is puzzled.&nbsp; Poor man, he doesn&rsquo;t know
what to do . . .&nbsp; Oho, he thinks he will move there, does he?&nbsp;
Much good that will do him. . . .&nbsp; Never have I seen such a mess
as he is in . . . he cannot do anything, he is absolutely helpless,
helpless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you take my bishop, do you?&nbsp; Much I care for that.&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; See, I give you check.&nbsp; Ah, now he is in a fright!&nbsp;
He doesn&rsquo;t know where to go.&nbsp; What a mess he is in . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the game proceeded, with a brisk exchange of pieces and incivilities
and a fluctuation of fortunes, till the little banker lost his queen
as the result of an incautious move, and, after several woebegone contortions
of his shoulders and hands, declined further contest.&nbsp; A sleek-headed
piccolo rushed forward to remove the board, and the erstwhile combatants
resumed the courteous dignity that they discarded in their chess-playing
moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the <i>Germania</i> to-day?&rdquo; asked Herr
Rebinok, as soon as the boy had receded to a respectful distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said von Kwarl, &ldquo;I never see the <i>Germania</i>.&nbsp;
I count on you to tell me if there is anything noteworthy in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has an article to-day headed, &lsquo;Occupation or Assimilation,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said the banker.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is of some importance, and well written.&nbsp;
It is very pessimistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catholic papers are always pessimistic about the things of
this world,&rdquo; said von Kwarl, &ldquo;just as they are unduly optimistic
about the things of the next world.&nbsp; What line does it take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says that our conquest of Britain can only result in a
temporary occupation, with a &lsquo;notice to quit&rsquo; always hanging
over our heads; that we can never hope to assimilate the people of these
islands in our Empire as a sort of maritime Saxony or Bavaria, all the
teaching of history is against it; Saxony and Bavaria are part of the
Empire because of their past history.&nbsp; England is being bound into
the Empire in spite of her past history; and so forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The writer of the article has not studied history very deeply,&rdquo;
said von Kwarl.&nbsp; &ldquo;The impossible thing that he speaks of
has been done before, and done in these very islands, too.&nbsp; The
Norman Conquest became an assimilation in comparatively few generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, in those days, yes,&rdquo; said the banker, &ldquo;but
the conditions were altogether different.&nbsp; There was not the rapid
transmission of news and the means of keeping the public mind instructed
in what was happening; in fact, one can scarcely say that the public
mind was there to instruct.&nbsp; There was not the same strong bond
of brotherhood between men of the same nation that exists now.&nbsp;
Northumberland was almost as foreign to Devon or Kent as Normandy was.&nbsp;
And the Church in those days was a great international factor, and the
Crusades bound men together fighting under one leader for a common cause.&nbsp;
Also there was not a great national past to be forgotten as there is
in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many factors, certainly, that are against us,&rdquo;
conceded the statesman, &ldquo;but you must also take into account those
that will help us.&nbsp; In most cases in recent history where the conquered
have stood out against all attempts at assimilation, there has been
a religious difference to add to the racial one&mdash;take Poland, for
instance, and the Catholic parts of Ireland.&nbsp; If the Bretons ever
seriously begin to assert their nationality as against the French, it
will be because they have remained more Catholic in practice and sentiment
than their neighbours.&nbsp; Here there is no such complication; we
are in the bulk a Protestant nation with a Catholic minority, and the
same may be said of the British.&nbsp; Then in modern days there is
the alchemy of Sport and the Drama to bring men of different races amicably
together.&nbsp; One or two sportsmanlike Germans in a London football
team will do more to break down racial antagonism than anything that
Governments or Councils can effect.&nbsp; As for the Stage, it has long
been international in its tendencies.&nbsp; You can see that every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;London is not our greatest difficulty,&rdquo; continued von
Kwarl.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must remember the steady influx of Germans since
the war; whole districts are changing the complexion of their inhabitants,
and in some streets you might almost fancy yourself in a German town.&nbsp;
We can scarcely hope to make much impression on the country districts
and the provincial towns at present, but you must remember that thousands
and thousands of the more virile and restless-souled men have emigrated,
and thousands more will follow their example.&nbsp; We shall fill up
their places with our own surplus population, as the Teuton races colonised
England in the old pre-Christian days.&nbsp; That is better, is it not,
to people the fat meadows of the Thames valley and the healthy downs
and uplands of Sussex and Berkshire than to go hunting for elbow-room
among the flies and fevers of the tropics?&nbsp; We have somewhere to
go to, now, better than the scrub and the veldt and the thorn-jungles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; assented Herr Rebinok, &ldquo;but
while this desirable process of infiltration and assimilation goes on,
how are you going to provide against the hostility of the conquered
nation?&nbsp; A people with a great tradition behind them and the ruling
instinct strongly developed, won&rsquo;t sit with their eyes closed
and their hands folded while you carry on the process of Germanisation.&nbsp;
What will keep them quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hopelessness of the situation.&nbsp; For centuries Britain
has ruled the seas, and been able to dictate to half the world in consequence;
then she let slip the mastery of the seas, as something too costly and
onerous to keep up, something which aroused too much jealousy and uneasiness
in others, and now the seas rule her.&nbsp; Every wave that breaks on
her shore rattles the keys of her prison.&nbsp; I am no fire-eater,
Herr Rebinok, but I confess that when I am at Dover, say, or Southampton,
and see those dark blots on the sea and those grey specks in the sky,
our battleships and cruisers and aircraft, and realise what they mean
to us my heart beats just a little quicker.&nbsp; If every German was
flung out of England to-morrow, in three weeks&rsquo; time we should
be coming in again on our own terms.&nbsp; With our sea scouts and air
scouts spread in organised network around, not a shipload of foodstuff
could reach the country.&nbsp; They know that; they can calculate how
many days of independence and starvation they could endure, and they
will make no attempt to bring about such a certain fiasco.&nbsp; Brave
men fight for a forlorn hope, but the bravest do not fight for an issue
they know to be hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said Herr Rebinok, &ldquo;as things are
at present they can do nothing from within, absolutely nothing.&nbsp;
We have weighed all that beforehand.&nbsp; But, as the <i>Germania</i>
points out, there is another Britain beyond the seas.&nbsp; Supposing
the Court at Delhi were to engineer a league&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A league?&nbsp; A league with whom?&rdquo; interrupted the
statesman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Russia we can watch and hold.&nbsp; We are rather
nearer to its western frontier than Delhi is, and we could throttle
its Baltic trade at five hours&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; France and Holland
are not inclined to provoke our hostility; they would have everything
to lose by such a course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other forces in the world that might be arrayed
against us,&rdquo; argued the banker; &ldquo;the United States, Japan,
Italy, they all have navies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the teaching of history show you that it is the strong
Power, armed and ready, that has to suffer from the hostility of the
world?&rdquo; asked von Kwarl.&nbsp; &ldquo;As far as sentiment goes,
perhaps, but not in practice.&nbsp; The danger has always been for the
weak, dismembered nation.&nbsp; Think you a moment, has the enfeebled
scattered British Empire overseas no undefended territories that are
a temptation to her neighbours?&nbsp; Has Japan nothing to glean where
we have harvested?&nbsp; Are there no North American possessions which
might slip into other keeping?&nbsp; Has Russia herself no traditional
temptations beyond the Oxus?&nbsp; Mind you, we are not making the mistake
Napoleon made, when he forced all Europe to be for him or against him.&nbsp;
We threaten no world aggressions, we are satiated where he was insatiable.&nbsp;
We have cast down one overshadowing Power from the face of the world,
because it stood in our way, but we have made no attempt to spread our
branches over all the space that it covered.&nbsp; We have not tried
to set up a tributary Canadian republic or to partition South Africa;
we have dreamed no dream of making ourselves Lords of Hindostan.&nbsp;
On the contrary, we have given proof of our friendly intentions towards
our neighbours.&nbsp; We backed France up the other day in her squabble
with Spain over the Moroccan boundaries, and proclaimed our opinion
that the Republic had as indisputable a mission on the North Africa
coast as we have in the North Sea.&nbsp; That is not the action or the
language of aggression.&nbsp; No,&rdquo; continued von Kwarl, after
a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;the world may fear us and dislike us,
but, for the present at any rate, there will be no leagues against us.&nbsp;
No, there is one rock on which our attempt at assimilation will founder
or find firm anchorage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth of the country, the generation that is at the threshold
now.&nbsp; It is them that we must capture.&nbsp; We must teach them
to learn, and coax them to forget.&nbsp; In course of time Anglo-Saxon
may blend with German, as the Elbe Saxons and the Bavarians and Swabians
have blended with the Prussians into a loyal united people under the
sceptre of the Hohenzollerns.&nbsp; Then we should be doubly strong,
Rome and Carthage rolled into one, an Empire of the West greater than
Charlemagne ever knew.&nbsp; Then we could look Slav and Latin and Asiatic
in the face and keep our place as the central dominant force of the
civilised world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker paused for a moment and drank a deep draught of wine,
as though he were invoking the prosperity of that future world-power.&nbsp;
Then he resumed in a more level tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, the younger generation of Britons may grow
up in hereditary hatred, repulsing all our overtures, forgetting nothing
and forgiving nothing, waiting and watching for the time when some weakness
assails us, when some crisis entangles us, when we cannot be everywhere
at once.&nbsp; Then our work will be imperilled, perhaps undone.&nbsp;
There lies the danger, there lies the hope, the younger generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another danger,&rdquo; said the banker, after he
had pondered over von Kwarl&rsquo;s remarks for a moment or two amid
the incense-clouds of a fat cigar; &ldquo;a danger that I foresee in
the immediate future; perhaps not so much a danger as an element of
exasperation which may ultimately defeat your plans.&nbsp; The law as
to military service will have to be promulgated shortly, and that cannot
fail to be bitterly unpopular.&nbsp; The people of these islands will
have to be brought into line with the rest of the Empire in the matter
of military training and military service, and how will they like that?&nbsp;
Will not the enforcing of such a measure enfuriate them against us?&nbsp;
Remember, they have made great sacrifices to avoid the burden of military
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear God,&rdquo; exclaimed Herr von Kwarl, &ldquo;as you say,
they have made sacrifices on that altar!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII: THE LURE</h2>
<p>Cicely had successfully insisted on having her own way concerning
the projected supper-party; Yeovil had said nothing further in opposition
to it, whatever his feelings on the subject might be.&nbsp; Having gained
her point, however, she was anxious to give her husband the impression
of having been consulted, and to put her victory as far as possible
on the footing of a compromise.&nbsp; It was also rather a relief to
be able to discuss the matter out of range of Joan&rsquo;s disconcerting
tongue and observant eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not really annoyed about this silly supper-party,&rdquo;
she said on the morning before the much-talked-of first night.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had pledged myself to give it, so I couldn&rsquo;t back out
without seeming mean to Gorla, and in any case it would have been impolitic
to cry off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why impolitic?&rdquo; asked Yeovil coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would give offence in quarters where I don&rsquo;t want
to give offence,&rdquo; said Cicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In quarters where the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i> is an object
of solicitude,&rdquo; said Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Cicely in her most disarming manner,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just as well to be perfectly frank about the whole
matter.&nbsp; If one wants to live in the London of the present day
one must make up one&rsquo;s mind to accept the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>
with as good a grace as possible.&nbsp; I do want to live in London,
and I don&rsquo;t want to change my way of living and start under different
conditions in some other place.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t face the prospect
of tearing up my life by the roots; I feel certain that I shouldn&rsquo;t
bear transplanting.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine myself recreating my
circle of interests in some foreign town or colonial centre or even
in a country town in England.&nbsp; India I couldn&rsquo;t stand.&nbsp;
London is not merely a home to me, it is a world, and it happens to
be just the world that suits me and that I am suited to.&nbsp; The German
occupation, or whatever one likes to call it, is a calamity, but it&rsquo;s
not like a molten deluge from Vesuvius that need send us all scuttling
away from another Pompeii.&nbsp; Of course,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;there
are things that jar horribly on one, even when one has got more or less
accustomed to them, but one must just learn to be philosophical and
bear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing they are not bearable?&rdquo; said Yeovil; &ldquo;during
the few days that I&rsquo;ve been in the land I&rsquo;ve seen things
that I cannot imagine will ever be bearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because they&rsquo;re new to you,&rdquo; said Cicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish that they should ever come to seem bearable,&rdquo;
retorted Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been bred and reared as a unit
of a ruling race; I don&rsquo;t want to find myself settling down resignedly
as a member of an enslaved one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to make things out worse than they are,&rdquo;
protested Cicely.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a military disaster on
a big scale, and there&rsquo;s been a great political dislocation in
consequence.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no reason why everything shouldn&rsquo;t
right itself in time, as it has done after other similar disasters in
the history of nations.&nbsp; We are not scattered to the winds or wiped
off the face of the earth, we are still an important racial unit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A racial unit in a foreign Empire,&rdquo; commented Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may arrive at the position of being the dominant factor
in that Empire,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;impressing our national characteristics
on it, and perhaps dictating its dynastic future and the whole trend
of its policy.&nbsp; Such things have happened in history.&nbsp; Or
we may become strong enough to throw off the foreign connection at a
moment when it can be done effectually and advantageously.&nbsp; But
meanwhile it is necessary to preserve our industrial life and our social
life, and for that reason we must accommodate ourselves to present circumstances,
however distasteful they may be.&nbsp; Emigration to some colonial wilderness,
or holding ourselves rigidly aloof from the life of the capital, won&rsquo;t
help matters.&nbsp; Really, Murrey, if you will think things over a
bit, you will see that the course I am following is the one dictated
by sane patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom the gods wish to render harmless they first afflict with
sanity,&rdquo; said Yeovil bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may be content
to wait for a hundred years or so, for this national revival to creep
and crawl us back into a semblance of independence and world-importance.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t the patience or the philosophy to sit
down comfortably and wait for a change of fortune that won&rsquo;t come
in my time&mdash;if it comes at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely changed the drift of the conversation; she had only introduced
the argument for the purpose of defining her point of view and accustoming
Yeovil to it, as one leads a nervous horse up to an unfamiliar barrier
that he is required eventually to jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;from the immediately
practical standpoint England is the best place for you till you have
shaken off all traces of that fever.&nbsp; Pass the time away somehow
till the hunting begins, and then go down to the East Wessex country;
they are looking out for a new master after this season, and if you
were strong enough you might take it on for a while.&nbsp; You could
go to Norway for fishing in the summer and hunt the East Wessex in the
winter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come down and do a bit of hunting too, and
we&rsquo;ll have house-parties, and get a little golf in between whiles.&nbsp;
It will be like old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil looked at his wife and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that old fellow who used to hunt his hounds regularly
through the fiercest times of the great Civil War?&nbsp; There is a
picture of him, by Caton Woodville, I think, leading his pack between
King Charles&rsquo;s army and the Parliament forces just as some battle
was going to begin.&nbsp; I have often thought that the King must have
disliked him rather more than he disliked the men who were in arms against
him; they at least cared, one way or the other.&nbsp; I fancy that old
chap would have a great many imitators nowadays, though, when it came
to be a question of sport against soldiering.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether anyone has said it, but one might almost assert that the German
victory was won on the golf-links of Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should saddle one particular form
of sport with a special responsibility,&rdquo; protested Cicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;except that it absorbed
perhaps more of the energy and attention of the leisured class than
other sports did, and in this country the leisured class was the only
bulwark we had against official indifference.&nbsp; The working classes
had a big share of the apathy, and, indirectly, a greater share of the
responsibility, because the voting power was in their hands.&nbsp; They
had not the leisure, however, to sit down and think clearly what the
danger was; their own industrial warfare was more real to them than
anything that was threatening from the nation that they only knew from
samples of German clerks and German waiters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;as regards the hunting,
there is no Civil War or national war raging just now, and there is
no immediate likelihood of one.&nbsp; A good many hunting seasons will
have to come and go before we can think of a war of independence as
even a distant possibility, and in the meantime hunting and horse-breeding
and country sports generally are the things most likely to keep Englishmen
together on the land.&nbsp; That is why so many men who hate the German
occupation are trying to keep field sports alive, and in the right hands.&nbsp;
However, I won&rsquo;t go on arguing.&nbsp; You and I always think things
out for ourselves and decide for ourselves, which is much the best way
in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely slipped away to her writing-room to make final arrangements
over the telephone for the all-important supper-party, leaving Yeovil
to turn over in his mind the suggestion that she had thrown out.&nbsp;
It was an obvious lure, a lure to draw him away from the fret and fury
that possessed him so inconveniently, but its obvious nature did not
detract from its effectiveness.&nbsp; Yeovil had pleasant recollections
of the East Wessex, a cheery little hunt that afforded good sport in
an unpretentious manner, a joyous thread of life running through a rather
sleepy countryside, like a merry brook careering through a placid valley.&nbsp;
For a man coming slowly and yet eagerly back to the activities of life
from the weariness of a long fever, the prospect of a leisurely season
with the East Wessex was singularly attractive, and side by side with
its attractiveness there was a tempting argument in favour of yielding
to its attractions.&nbsp; Among the small squires and yeoman farmers,
doctors, country tradesmen, auctioneers and so forth who would gather
at the covert-side and at the hunt breakfasts, there might be a local
nucleus of revolt against the enslavement of the land, a discouraged
and leaderless band waiting for some one to mould their resistance into
effective shape and keep their loyalty to the old dynasty and the old
national cause steadily burning.&nbsp; Yeovil could see himself taking
up that position, stimulating the spirit of hostility to the <i>fait</i>
<i>accompli</i>, organising stubborn opposition to every Germanising
influence that was brought into play, schooling the youth of the countryside
to look steadily Delhiward.&nbsp; That was the bait that Yeovil threw
out to his conscience, while slowly considering the other bait that
was appealing so strongly to his senses.&nbsp; The dry warm scent of
the stable, the nip of the morning air, the pleasant squelch-squelch
of the saddle leather, the moist earthy fragrance of the autumn woods
and wet fallows, the cold white mists of winter days, the whimper of
hounds and the hot restless pushing of the pack through ditch and hedgerow
and undergrowth, the birds that flew up and clucked and chattered as
you passed, the hearty greeting and pleasant gossip in farmhouse kitchens
and market-day bar-parlours&mdash;all these remembered delights of the
chase marshalled themselves in the brain, and made a cumulative appeal
that came with special intensity to a man who was a little tired of
his wanderings, more than a little drawn away from the jarring centres
of life.&nbsp; The hot London sunshine baking the soot-grimed walls
and the ugly incessant hoot and grunt of the motor traffic gave an added
charm to the vision of hill and hollow and copse that flickered in Yeovil&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; Slowly, with a sensuous lingering over detail, his imagination
carried him down to a small, sleepy, yet withal pleasantly bustling
market town, and placed him unerringly in a wide straw-littered yard,
half-full of men and quarter-full of horses, with a bob-tailed sheep-dog
or two trying not to get in everybody&rsquo;s way, but insisting on
being in the thick of things.&nbsp; The horses gradually detached themselves
from the crowd of unimportant men and came one by one into momentary
prominence, to be discussed and appraised for their good points and
bad points, and finally to be bid for.&nbsp; And always there was one
horse that detached itself conspicuously from the rest, the ideal hunter,
or at any rate, Yeovil&rsquo;s ideal of the ideal hunter.&nbsp; Mentally
it was put through its paces before him, its pedigree and brief history
recounted to him; mentally he saw a stable lad put it over a jump or
two, with credit to all concerned, and inevitably he saw himself outbidding
less discerning rivals and securing the desired piece of horseflesh,
to be the chief glory and mainstay of his hunting stable, to carry him
well and truly and cleverly through many a joyous long-to-be-remembered
run.&nbsp; That scene had been one of the recurring half-waking dreams
of his long days of weakness in the far-away Finnish nursing-home, a
dream sometimes of tantalising mockery, sometimes of pleasure in the
foretaste of a joy to come.&nbsp; And now it need scarcely be a dream
any longer, he had only to go down at the right moment and take an actual
part in his oft-rehearsed vision.&nbsp; Everything would be there, exactly
as his imagination had placed it, even down to the bob-tailed sheep-dogs;
the horse of his imagining would be there waiting for him, or if not
absolutely the ideal animal, something very like it.&nbsp; He might
even go beyond the limits of his dream and pick up a couple of desirable
animals&mdash;there would probably be fewer purchasers for good class
hunters in these days than of yore.&nbsp; And with the coming of this
reflection his dream faded suddenly and his mind came back with a throb
of pain to the things he had for the moment forgotten, the weary, hateful
things that were symbolised for him by the standard that floated yellow
and black over the frontage of Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>Yeovil wandered down to his snuggery, a mood of listless dejection
possessing him.&nbsp; He fidgetted aimlessly with one or two books and
papers, filled a pipe, and half filled a waste-paper basket with torn
circulars and accumulated writing-table litter.&nbsp; Then he lit the
pipe and settled down in his most comfortable armchair with an old note-book
in his hand.&nbsp; It was a sort of disjointed diary, running fitfully
through the winter months of some past years, and recording noteworthy
days with the East Wessex.</p>
<p>And over the telephone Cicely talked and arranged and consulted with
men and women to whom the joys of a good gallop or the love of a stricken
fatherland were as letters in an unknown alphabet.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII: THE FIRST-NIGHT</h2>
<p>Huge posters outside the Caravansery Theatre of Varieties announced
the first performance of the uniquely interesting Suggestion Dances,
interpreted by the Hon. Gorla Mustelford.&nbsp; An impressionist portrait
of a rather severe-looking young woman gave the public some idea of
what the <i>danseuse</i> might be like in appearance, and the further
information was added that her performance was the greatest dramatic
event of the season.&nbsp; Yet another piece of information was conveyed
to the public a few minutes after the doors had opened, in the shape
of large notices bearing the brief announcement, &ldquo;house full.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For the first-night function most of the seats had been reserved for
specially-invited guests or else bespoken by those who considered it
due to their own importance to be visible on such an occasion.</p>
<p>Even at the commencement of the ordinary programme of the evening
(Gorla was not due to appear till late in the list) the theatre was
crowded with a throng of chattering, expectant human beings; it seemed
as though every one had come early to see every one else arrive.&nbsp;
As a matter of fact it was the rumour-heralded arrival of one personage
in particular that had drawn people early to their seats and given a
double edge to the expectancy of the moment.</p>
<p>At first sight and first hearing the bulk of the audience seemed
to comprise representatives of the chief European races in well-distributed
proportions, but if one gave it closer consideration it could be seen
that the distribution was geographically rather than ethnographically
diversified.&nbsp; Men and women there were from Paris, Munich, Rome,
Moscow and Vienna, from Sweden and Holland and divers other cities and
countries, but in the majority of cases the Jordan Valley had supplied
their forefathers with a common cradle-ground.&nbsp; The lack of a fire
burning on a national altar seemed to have drawn them by universal impulse
to the congenial flare of the footlights, whether as artists, producers,
impresarios, critics, agents, go-betweens, or merely as highly intelligent
and fearsomely well-informed spectators.&nbsp; They were prominent in
the chief seats, they were represented, more sparsely but still in fair
numbers, in the cheaper places, and everywhere they were voluble, emphatic,
sanguine or sceptical, prodigal of word and gesture, with eyes that
seemed to miss nothing and acknowledge nothing, and a general restless
dread of not being seen and noticed.&nbsp; Of the theatre-going London
public there was also a fair muster, more particularly centred in the
less expensive parts of the house, while in boxes, stalls and circles
a sprinkling of military uniforms gave an unfamiliar tone to the scene
in the eyes of those who had not previously witnessed a first-night
performance under the new conditions.</p>
<p>Yeovil, while standing aloof from his wife&rsquo;s participation
in this social event, had made private arrangements for being a personal
spectator of the scene; as one of the ticket-buying public he had secured
a seat in the back row of a low-priced gallery, whence he might watch,
observant and unobserved, the much talked-of d&eacute;but of Gorla Mustelford,
and the writing of a new chapter in the history of the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&nbsp;
Around him he noticed an incessant undercurrent of jangling laughter,
an unending give-and-take of meaningless mirthless jest and catchword.&nbsp;
He had noticed the same thing in streets and public places since his
arrival in London, a noisy, empty interchange of chaff and laughter
that he had been at a loss to account for.&nbsp; The Londoner is not
well adapted for the irresponsible noisiness of jesting tongue that
bubbles up naturally in a Southern race, and the effort to be volatile
was the more noticeable because it so obviously was an effort.&nbsp;
Turning over the pages of a book that told the story of Bulgarian social
life in the days of Turkish rule, Yeovil had that morning come across
a passage that seemed to throw some light on the thing that had puzzled
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bondage has this one advantage: it makes a nation merry.&nbsp;
Where far-reaching ambition has no scope for its development the community
squanders its energy on the trivial and personal cares of its daily
life, and seeks relief and recreation in simple and easily obtained
material enjoyment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer was a man who had known
bondage, so he spoke at any rate with authority.&nbsp; Of the London
of the moment it could not, however, be said with any truth that it
was merry, but merely that its inhabitants made desperate endeavour
not to appear crushed under their catastrophe.&nbsp; Surrounded as he
was now with a babble of tongues and shrill mechanical repartee, Yeovil&rsquo;s
mind went back to the book and its account of a theatre audience in
the Turkish days of Bulgaria, with its light and laughing crowd of critics
and spectators.&nbsp; Bulgaria!&nbsp; The thought of that determined
little nation came to him with a sharp sense of irony.&nbsp; There was
a people who had not thought it beneath the dignity of their manhood
to learn the trade and discipline of arms.&nbsp; They had their reward;
torn and exhausted and debt-encumbered from their campaigns, they were
masters in their own house, the Bulgarian flag flew over the Bulgarian
mountains.&nbsp; And Yeovil stole a glance at the crown of Charlemagne
set over the Royal box.</p>
<p>In a capacious box immediately opposite the one set aside for royalty
the Lady Shalem sat in well-considered prominence, confident that every
press critic and reporter would note her presence, and that one or two
of them would describe, or misdescribe, her toilet.&nbsp; Already quite
a considerable section of the audience knew her by name, and the frequency
with which she graciously nodded towards various quarters of the house
suggested the presence of a great many personal acquaintances.&nbsp;
She had attained to that desirable feminine altitude of purse and position
when people who go about everywhere know you well by sight and have
never met your dress before.</p>
<p>Lady Shalem was a woman of commanding presence, of that type which
suggests a consciousness that the command may not necessarily be obeyed;
she had observant eyes and a well-managed voice.&nbsp; Her successes
in life had been worked for, but they were also to some considerable
extent the result of accident.&nbsp; Her public history went back to
the time when, in the person of her husband, Mr. Conrad Dort, she had
contested two hopeless and very expensive Parliamentary elections on
behalf of her party; on each occasion the declaration of the poll had
shown a heavy though reduced majority on the wrong side, but she might
have perpetrated an apt misquotation of the French monarch&rsquo;s traditional
message after the defeat of Pavia, and assured the world &ldquo;all
is lost save honours.&rdquo;&nbsp; The forthcoming Honours List had
duly proclaimed the fact that Conrad Dort, Esquire, had entered Parliament
by another door as Baron Shalem, of Wireskiln, in the county of Suffolk.&nbsp;
Success had crowned the lady&rsquo;s efforts as far as the achievement
of the title went, but her social ambitions seemed unlikely to make
further headway.&nbsp; The new Baron and his wife, their title and money
notwithstanding, did not &ldquo;go down&rdquo; in their particular segment
of county society, and in London there were other titles and incomes
to compete with.&nbsp; People were willing to worship the Golden Calf,
but allowed themselves a choice of altars.&nbsp; No one could justly
say that the Shalems were either oppressively vulgar or insufferably
bumptious; probably the chief reason for their lack of popularity was
their intense and obvious desire to be popular.&nbsp; They kept open
house in such an insistently open manner that they created a social
draught.&nbsp; The people who accepted their invitations for the second
or third time were not the sort of people whose names gave importance
to a dinner party or a house gathering.&nbsp; Failure, in a thinly-disguised
form, attended the assiduous efforts of the Shalems to play a leading
r&ocirc;le in the world that they had climbed into.&nbsp; The Baron
began to observe to his acquaintances that &ldquo;gadding about&rdquo;
and entertaining on a big scale was not much in his line; a quiet after-dinner
pipe and talk with some brother legislator was his ideal way of spending
an evening.</p>
<p>Then came the great catastrophe, involving the old order of society
in the national overthrow.&nbsp; Lady Shalem, after a decent interval
of patriotic mourning, began to look around her and take stock of her
chances and opportunities under the new r&eacute;gime.&nbsp; It was
easier to achieve distinction as a titled oasis in the social desert
that London had become than it had been to obtain recognition as a new
growth in a rather overcrowded field.&nbsp; The observant eyes and agile
brain quickly noted this circumstance, and her ladyship set to work
to adapt herself to the altered conditions that governed her world.&nbsp;
Lord Shalem was one of the few Peers who kissed the hand of the new
Sovereign, his wife was one of the few hostesses who attempted to throw
a semblance of gaiety and lavish elegance over the travesty of a London
season following the year of disaster.&nbsp; The world of tradesmen
and purveyors and caterers, and the thousands who were dependent on
them for employment, privately blessed the example set by Shalem House,
whatever their feelings might be towards the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>,
and the august newcomer who had added an old Saxon kingdom and some
of its accretions to the Teutonic realm of Charlemagne was duly beholden
to an acquired subject who was willing to forget the bitterness of defeat
and to help others to forget it also.&nbsp; Among other acts of Imperial
recognition an earldom was being held in readiness for the Baron who
had known how to accept accomplished facts with a good grace.&nbsp;
One of the wits of the Cockatrice Club had asserted that the new earl
would take as supporters for his coat of arms a lion and a unicorn oubli&eacute;.</p>
<p>In the box with Lady Shalem was the Gr&auml;fin von Tolb, a well-dressed
woman of some fifty-six years, comfortable and placid in appearance,
yet alert withal, rather suggesting a thoroughly wide-awake dormouse.&nbsp;
Rich, amiable and intelligent were the adjectives which would best have
described her character and her life-story.&nbsp; In her own rather
difficult social circle at Paderborn she had earned for herself the
reputation of being one of the most tactful and discerning hostesses
in Germany, and it was generally suspected that she had come over and
taken up her residence in London in response to a wish expressed in
high quarters; the lavish hospitality which she dispensed at her house
in Berkeley Square was a considerable reinforcement to the stricken
social life of the metropolis.</p>
<p>In a neighbouring box Cicely Yeovil presided over a large and lively
party, which of course included Ronnie Storre, who was for once in a
way in a chattering mood, and also included an American dowager, who
had never been known to be in anything else.&nbsp; A tone of literary
distinction was imparted to the group by the presence of Augusta Smith,
better known under her pen-name of Rhapsodic Pantril, author of a play
that had had a limited but well-advertised success in Sheffield and
the United States of America, author also of a book of reminiscences,
entitled &ldquo;Things I Cannot Forget.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had beautiful
eyes, a knowledge of how to dress, and a pleasant disposition, cankered
just a little by a perpetual dread of the non-recognition of her genius.&nbsp;
As the woman, Augusta Smith, she probably would have been unreservedly
happy; as the super-woman, Rhapsodic Pantril, she lived within the border-line
of discontent.&nbsp; Her most ordinary remarks were framed with the
view of arresting attention; some one once said of her that she ordered
a sack of potatoes with the air of one who is making enquiry for a love-philtre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what colour the curtain is?&rdquo; she asked Cicely,
throwing a note of intense meaning into her question.</p>
<p>Cicely turned quickly and looked at the drop-curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a nice blue,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexandrine blue&mdash;<i>my</i> colour&mdash;the colour of
hope,&rdquo; said Rhapsodie impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes well with the general colour-scheme,&rdquo; said Cicely,
feeling that she was hardly rising to the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is it really true that His Majesty is coming?&rdquo;
asked the lively American dowager.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put on my
nooest frock and my best diamonds on purpose, and I shall be mortified
to death if he doesn&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; pouted Ronnie, &ldquo;I felt certain you&rsquo;d
put them on for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, I should have put on rubies and orange opals for you.&nbsp;
People with our colour of hair always like barbaric display&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ronnie, &ldquo;they have chaste
cold tastes.&nbsp; You are absolutely mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I ought to know!&rdquo; protested the dowager;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived longer in the world than you have, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ronnie with devastating truthfulness, &ldquo;but
my hair has been this colour longer than yours has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peace was restored by the opportune arrival of a middle-aged man
of blond North-German type, with an expression of brutality on his rather
stupid face, who sat in the front of the box for a few minutes on a
visit of ceremony to Cicely.&nbsp; His appearance caused a slight buzz
of recognition among the audience, and if Yeovil had cared to make enquiry
of his neighbours he might have learned that this decorated and obviously
important personage was the redoubtable von Kwarl, artificer and shaper
of much of the statecraft for which other men got the public credit.</p>
<p>The orchestra played a selection from the &ldquo;Gondola Girl,&rdquo;
which was the leading musical-comedy of the moment.&nbsp; Most of the
audience, those in the more expensive seats at any rate, heard the same
airs two or three times daily, at restaurant lunches, teas, dinners
and suppers, and occasionally in the Park; they were justified therefore
in treating the music as a background to slightly louder conversation
than they had hitherto indulged in.&nbsp; The music came to an end,
episode number two in the evening&rsquo;s entertainment was signalled,
the curtain of Alexandrine blue rolled heavily upward, and a troupe
of performing wolves was presented to the public.&nbsp; Yeovil had encountered
wolves in North Africa deserts and in Siberian forest and wold, he had
seen them at twilight stealing like dark shadows across the snow, and
heard their long whimpering howl in the darkness amid the pines; he
could well understand how a magic lore had grown up round them through
the ages among the peoples of four continents, how their name had passed
into a hundred strange sayings and inspired a hundred traditions.&nbsp;
And now he saw them ride round the stage on tricycles, with grotesque
ruffles round their necks and clown caps on their heads, their eyes
blinking miserably in the blaze of the footlights.&nbsp; In response
to the applause of the house a stout, atrociously smiling man in evening
dress came forward and bowed; he had had nothing to do either with the
capture or the training of the animals, having bought them ready for
use from a continental emporium where wild beasts were prepared for
the music-hall market, but he continued bowing and smiling till the
curtain fell.</p>
<p>Two American musicians with comic tendencies (denoted by the elaborate
rags and tatters of their costumes) succeeded the wolves.&nbsp; Their
musical performance was not without merit, but their comic &ldquo;business&rdquo;
seemed to have been invented long ago by some man who had patented a
monopoly of all music-hall humour and forthwith retired from the trade.&nbsp;
Some day, Yeovil reflected, the rights of the monopoly might expire
and new &ldquo;business&rdquo; become available for the knockabout profession.</p>
<p>The audience brightened considerably when item number five of the
programme was signalled.&nbsp; The orchestra struck up a rollicking
measure and Tony Luton made his entrance amid a rousing storm of applause.&nbsp;
He was dressed as an errand-boy of some West End shop, with a livery
and box-tricycle, as spruce and decorative as the most ambitious errand-boy
could see himself in his most ambitious dreams.&nbsp; His song was a
lively and very audacious chronicle of life behind the scenes of a big
retail establishment, and sparkled with allusions which might fitly
have been described as suggestive&mdash;at any rate they appeared to
suggest meanings to the audience quite as clearly as Gorla Mustelford&rsquo;s
dances were likely to do, even with the aid, in her case, of long explanations
on the programmes.&nbsp; When the final verse seemed about to reach
an unpardonable climax a stage policeman opportunely appeared and moved
the lively songster on for obstructing the imaginary traffic of an imaginary
Bond Street.&nbsp; The house received the new number with genial enthusiasm,
and mingled its applause with demands for an earlier favourite.&nbsp;
The orchestra struck up the familiar air, and in a few moments the smart
errand-boy, transformed now into a smart jockey, was singing &ldquo;They
quaff the gay bubbly in Eccleston Square&rdquo; to an audience that
hummed and nodded its unstinted approval.</p>
<p>The next number but one was the Gorla Mustelford d&eacute;but, and
the house settled itself down to yawn and fidget and chatter for ten
or twelve minutes while a troupe of talented Japanese jugglers performed
some artistic and quite uninteresting marvels with fans and butterflies
and lacquer boxes.&nbsp; The interval of waiting was not destined, however,
to be without its interest; in its way it provided the one really important
and dramatic moment of the evening.&nbsp; One or two uniforms and evening
toilettes had already made their appearance in the Imperial box; now
there was observable in that quarter a slight commotion, an unobtrusive
reshuffling and reseating, and then every eye in the suddenly quiet
semi-darkened house focussed itself on one figure.&nbsp; There was no
public demonstration from the newly-loyal, it had been particularly
wished that there should be none, but a ripple of whisper went through
the vast audience from end to end.&nbsp; Majesty had arrived.&nbsp;
The Japanese marvel-workers went through their display with even less
attention than before.&nbsp; Lady Shalem, sitting well in the front
of her box, lowered her observant eyes to her programme and her massive
bangles.&nbsp; The evidence of her triumph did not need staring at.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX: AN EVENING &ldquo;TO BE REMEMBERED&rdquo;</h2>
<p>To the uninitiated or unappreciative the dancing of Gorla Mustelford
did not seem widely different from much that had been exhibited aforetime
by exponents of the posturing school.&nbsp; She was not naturally graceful
of movement, she had not undergone years of arduous tutelage, she had
not the instinct for sheer joyous energy of action that is stored in
some natures; out of these unpromising negative qualities she had produced
a style of dancing that might best be labelled a conscientious departure
from accepted methods.&nbsp; The highly imaginative titles that she
had bestowed on her dances, the &ldquo;Life of a fern,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Soul-dream
of a topaz,&rdquo; and so forth, at least gave her audience and her
critics something to talk about.&nbsp; In themselves they meant absolutely
nothing, but they induced discussion, and that to Gorla meant a great
deal.&nbsp; It was a season of dearth and emptiness in the footlights
and box-office world, and her performance received a welcome that would
scarcely have befallen it in a more crowded and prosperous day.&nbsp;
Her success, indeed, had been waiting for her, ready-made, as far as
the managerial profession was concerned, and nothing had been left undone
in the way of advertisement to secure for it the appearance, at any
rate, of popular favour.&nbsp; And loud above the interested applause
of those who had personal or business motives for acclaiming a success
swelled the exaggerated enthusiasm of the fairly numerous art-satellites
who are unstinted in their praise of anything that they are certain
they cannot understand.&nbsp; Whatever might be the subsequent verdict
of the theatre-filling public the majority of the favoured first-night
audience was determined to set the seal of its approval on the suggestion
dances, and a steady roll of applause greeted the conclusion of each
item.&nbsp; The dancer gravely bowed her thanks; in marked contradistinction
to the gentleman who had &ldquo;presented&rdquo; the performing wolves
she did not permit herself the luxury of a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It teaches us a great deal,&rdquo; said Rhapsodic Pantril
vaguely, but impressively, after the Fern dance had been given and applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate we know now that a fern takes life very seriously,&rdquo;
broke in Joan Mardle, who had somehow wriggled herself into Cicely&rsquo;s
box.</p>
<p>As Yeovil, from the back of his gallery, watched Gorla running and
ricochetting about the stage, looking rather like a wagtail in energetic
pursuit of invisible gnats and midges, he wondered how many of the middle-aged
women who were eagerly applauding her would have taken the least notice
of similar gymnastics on the part of their offspring in nursery or garden,
beyond perhaps asking them not to make so much noise.&nbsp; And a bitterer
tinge came to his thoughts as he saw the bouquets being handed up, thoughts
of the brave old dowager down at Torywood, the woman who had worked
and wrought so hard and so unsparingly in her day for the well-being
of the State&mdash;the State that had fallen helpless into alien hands
before her tired eyes.&nbsp; Her eldest son lived invalid-wise in the
South of France, her second son lay fathoms deep in the North Sea, with
the hulk of a broken battleship for a burial-vault; and now the grand-daughter
was standing here in the limelight, bowing her thanks for the patronage
and favour meted out to her by this cosmopolitan company, with its lavish
sprinkling of the uniforms of an alien army.</p>
<p>Prominent among the flowers at her feet was one large golden-petalled
bouquet of gorgeous blooms, tied with a broad streamer of golden riband,
the tribute rendered by C&aelig;sar to the things that were C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The new chapter of the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i> had been written
that night and written well.&nbsp; The audience poured slowly out with
the triumphant music of Jancovius&rsquo;s <i>Kaiser</i> <i>Wilhelm</i>
march, played by the orchestra as a happy inspiration, pealing in its
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a great evening, a most successful evening,&rdquo;
said Lady Shalem to Herr von Kwarl, whom she was conveying in her electric
brougham to Cicely Yeovil&rsquo;s supper party; &ldquo;an important
evening,&rdquo; she added, choosing her adjectives with deliberation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It should give pleasure in high quarters, should it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she turned her observant eyes on the impassive face of her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious lady,&rdquo; he replied with deliberation and meaning,
&ldquo;it has given pleasure.&nbsp; It is an evening to be remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gracious lady suppressed a sigh of satisfaction.&nbsp; Memory
in high places was a thing fruitful and precious beyond computation.</p>
<p>Cicely&rsquo;s party at the Porphyry Restaurant had grown to imposing
dimensions.&nbsp; Every one whom she had asked had come, and so had
Joan Mardle.&nbsp; Lady Shalem had suggested several names at the last
moment, and there was quite a strong infusion of the Teutonic military
and official world.&nbsp; It was just as well, Cicely reflected, that
the supper was being given at a restaurant and not in Berkshire Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite like ole times,&rdquo; purred the beaming proprietor
in Cicely&rsquo;s ear, as the staircase and cloak-rooms filled up with
a jostling, laughing throng.</p>
<p>The guests settled themselves at four tables, taking their places
where chance or fancy led them, late comers having to fit in wherever
they could find room.&nbsp; A babel of tongues in various languages
reigned round the tables, amid which the rattle of knives and forks
and plates and the popping of corks made a subdued hubbub.&nbsp; Gorla
Mustelford, the motive for all this sound and movement, this chatter
of guests and scurrying of waiters, sat motionless in the fatigued self-conscious
silence of a great artist who has delivered a great message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do sit at Lady Peach&rsquo;s table, like a dear boy,&rdquo;
Cicely begged of Tony Luton, who had come in late; &ldquo;she and Gerald
Drowly have got together, in spite of all my efforts, and they are both
so dull.&nbsp; Try and liven things up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud barking sound, as of fur-seals calling across Arctic ice,
came from another table, where Mrs. Mentieth-Mendlesohnn (one of the
Mendlesohnns of Invergordon, as she was wont to describe herself) was
proclaiming the glories and subtleties of Gorla&rsquo;s achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a revelation,&rdquo; she shouted; &ldquo;I sat there
and saw a whole new scheme of thought unfold itself before my eyes.&nbsp;
One could not define it, it was thought translated into action&mdash;the
best art cannot be defined.&nbsp; One just sat there and knew that one
was seeing something one had never seen before, and yet one felt that
one had seen it, in one&rsquo;s brain, all one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; That
was what was so wonderful&mdash;yes, please,&rdquo; she broke off sharply
as a fat quail in aspic was presented to her by a questioning waiter.</p>
<p>The voice of Mr. Mauleverer Morle came across the table, like another
seal barking at a greater distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rostand,&rdquo; he observed with studied emphasis, &ldquo;has
been called <i>le</i> <i>Prince</i> <i>de</i> <i>l&rsquo;adjectif</i>
<i>Inopin&egrave;</i>; Miss Mustelford deserves to be described as the
Queen of Unexpected Movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, do you hear that?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Mentieth-Mendlesohnn
to as wide an audience as she could achieve; &ldquo;Rostand has been
called&mdash;tell them what you said, Mr. Morle,&rdquo; she broke off,
suddenly mistrusting her ability to handle a French sentence at the
top of her voice.</p>
<p>Mr. Morle repeated his remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass it on to the next table,&rdquo; commanded Mrs. Mentieth-Mendlesohnn.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too good to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next table however, a grave impressive voice was dwelling
at length on a topic remote from the event of the evening.&nbsp; Lady
Peach considered that all social gatherings, of whatever nature, were
intended for the recital of minor domestic tragedies.&nbsp; She lost
no time in regaling the company around her with the detailed history
of an interrupted week-end in a Norfolk cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most charming and delightful old-world spot that you could
imagine, clean and quite comfortable, just a nice distance from the
sea and within an easy walk of the Broads.&nbsp; The very place for
the children.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d brought everything for a four days&rsquo;
stay and meant to have a really delightful time.&nbsp; And then on Sunday
morning we found that some one had left the springhead, where our only
supply of drinking water came from, uncovered, and a dead bird was floating
in it; it had fallen in somehow and got drowned.&nbsp; Of course we
couldn&rsquo;t use the water that a dead body had been floating in,
and there was no other supply for miles round, so we had to come away
then and there.&nbsp; Now what do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, that a linnet should die in the Spring,&rsquo;&rdquo;
quoted Tony Luton with intense feeling.</p>
<p>There was an immediate outburst of hilarity where Lady Peach had
confidently looked for expressions of concern and sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Tony just perfectly cute?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
exclaimed a young American woman, with an enthusiasm to which Lady Peach
entirely failed to respond.&nbsp; She had intended following up her
story with the account of another tragedy of a similar nature that had
befallen her three years ago in Argyllshire, and now the opportunity
had gone.&nbsp; She turned morosely to the consolations of a tongue
salad.</p>
<p>At the centre table the excellent von Tolb led a chorus of congratulation
and compliment, to which Gorla listened with an air of polite detachment,
much as the Sheikh Ul Islam might receive the homage of a Wesleyan Conference.&nbsp;
To a close observer it would have seemed probable that her attitude
of fatigued indifference to the flattering remarks that were showered
on her had been as carefully studied and rehearsed as any of her postures
on the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something that one will appreciate more and more fully
every time one sees it . . . One cannot see it too often . . . I could
have sat and watched it for hours . . . Do you know, I am just looking
forward to to-morrow evening, when I can see it again. . . .&nbsp; I
knew it was going to be good, but I had no idea&mdash;&rdquo; so chimed
the chorus, between mouthfuls of quail and bites of asparagus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t the performing wolves wonderful?&rdquo; exclaimed
Joan in her fresh joyous voice, that rang round the room like laughter
of the woodpecker.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that disturbs the complacency of a great artist
of the Halls it is the consciousness of sharing his or her triumphs
with performing birds and animals, but of course Joan was not to be
expected to know that.&nbsp; She pursued her subject with the assurance
of one who has hit on a particularly acceptable topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have taken them years of training and concentration
to master those tricycles,&rdquo; she continued in high-pitched soliloquy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The nice thing about them is that they don&rsquo;t realise a
bit how clever and educational they are.&nbsp; It would be dreadful
to have them putting on airs, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And yet I suppose
the knowledge of being able to jump through a hoop better than any other
wolf would justify a certain amount of &lsquo;side.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately at this moment a young Italian journalist at another
table rose from his seat and delivered a two-minute oration in praise
of the heroine of the evening.&nbsp; He spoke in rapid nervous French,
with a North Italian accent, but much of what he said could be understood
by the majority of those present, and the applause was unanimous.&nbsp;
At any rate he had been brief and it was permissible to suppose that
he had been witty.</p>
<p>It was the opening for which Mr. Gerald Drowly had been watching
and waiting.&nbsp; The moment that the Italian enthusiast had dropped
back into his seat amid a rattle of hand-clapping and rapping of forks
and knives on the tables, Drowly sprang to his feet, pushed his chair
well away, as for a long separation, and begged to endorse what had
been so very aptly and gracefully, and, might he add, truly said by
the previous speaker.&nbsp; This was only the prelude to the real burden
of his message; with the dexterity that comes of practice he managed,
in a couple of hurried sentences, to divert the course of his remarks
to his own personality and career, and to inform his listeners that
he was an actor of some note and experience, and had had the honour
of acting under&mdash;and here followed a string of names of eminent
actor managers of the day.&nbsp; He thought he might be pardoned for
mentioning the fact that his performance of &ldquo;Peterkin&rdquo; in
the &ldquo;Broken Nutshell,&rdquo; had won the unstinted approval of
the dramatic critics of the Provincial press.&nbsp; Towards the end
of what was a long speech, and which seemed even longer to its hearers,
he reverted to the subject of Gorla&rsquo;s dancing and bestowed on
it such laudatory remarks as he had left over.&nbsp; Drawing his chair
once again into his immediate neighbourhood he sat down, aglow with
the satisfied consciousness of a good work worthily performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once acted a small part in some theatricals got up for a
charity,&rdquo; announced Joan in a ringing, confidential voice; &ldquo;the
<i>Clapham</i> <i>Courier</i> said that all the minor parts were very
creditably sustained.&nbsp; Those were its very words.&nbsp; I felt
I must tell you that, and also say how much I enjoyed Miss Mustelford&rsquo;s
dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tony Luton cheered wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cleverest speech so far,&rdquo; he proclaimed.&nbsp;
He had been asked to liven things up at his table and was doing his
best to achieve that result, but Mr. Gerald Drowly joined Lady Peach
in the unfavourable opinion she had formed of that irrepressible youth.</p>
<p>Ronnie, on whom Cicely kept a solicitous eye, showed no sign of any
intention of falling in love with Gorla.&nbsp; He was more profitably
engaged in paying court to the Gr&auml;fin von Tolb, whose hospitable
mansion in Belgrave Square invested her with a special interest in his
eyes.&nbsp; As a professional Prince Charming he had every inducement
to encourage the cult of Fairy Godmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, agreed, I will come and hear you play, that is a
promise,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin, &ldquo;and you must come and dine
with me one night and play to me afterwards, that is a promise, also,
yes?&nbsp; That is very nice of you, to come and see a tiresome old
woman.&nbsp; I am passionately fond of music; if I were honest I would
tell you also that I am very fond of good-looking boys, but this is
not the age of honesty, so I must leave you to guess that.&nbsp; Come
on Thursday in next week, you can?&nbsp; That is nice.&nbsp; I have
a reigning Prince dining with me that night.&nbsp; Poor man, he wants
cheering up; the art of being a reigning Prince is not a very pleasing
one nowadays.&nbsp; He has made it a boast all his life that he is Liberal
and his subjects Conservative; now that is all changed&mdash;no, not
all; he is still Liberal, but his subjects unfortunately are become
Socialists.&nbsp; You must play your best for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there many Socialists over there, in Germany I mean?&rdquo;
asked Ronnie, who was rather out of his depth where politics were concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ueberall</i>,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin with emphasis;
&ldquo;everywhere, I don&rsquo;t know what it comes from; better education
and worse digestions I suppose.&nbsp; I am sure digestion has a good
deal to do with it.&nbsp; In my husband&rsquo;s family for example,
his generation had excellent digestions, and there wasn&rsquo;t a case
of Socialism or suicide among them; the younger generation have no digestions
worth speaking of, and there have been two suicides and three Socialists
within the last six years.&nbsp; And now I must really be going.&nbsp;
I am not a Berliner and late hours don&rsquo;t suit my way of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie bent low over the Gr&auml;fin&rsquo;s hand and kissed it,
partly because she was the kind of woman who naturally invoked such
homage, but chiefly because he knew that the gesture showed off his
smooth burnished head to advantage.</p>
<p>The observant eyes of Lady Shalem had noted the animated conversation
between the Gr&auml;fin and Ronnie, and she had overheard fragments
of the invitation that had been accorded to the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take us the little foxes, the little foxes that spoil the
vines,&rdquo; she quoted to herself; &ldquo;not that that music-boy
would do much in the destructive line, but the principle is good.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X: SOME REFLECTIONS AND A &ldquo;TE DEUM&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Cicely awoke, on the morning after the &ldquo;memorable evening,&rdquo;
with the satisfactory feeling of victory achieved, tempered by a troubled
sense of having achieved it in the face of a reasonably grounded opposition.&nbsp;
She had burned her boats, and was glad of it, but the reek of their
burning drifted rather unpleasantly across the jubilant incense-swinging
of her <i>Te</i> <i>Deum</i> service.</p>
<p>Last night had marked an immense step forward in her social career;
without running after the patronage of influential personages she had
seen it quietly and tactfully put at her service.&nbsp; People such
as the Gr&auml;fin von Tolb were going to be a power in the London world
for a very long time to come.&nbsp; Herr von Kwarl, with all his useful
qualities of brain and temperament, might conceivably fall out of favour
in some unexpected turn of the political wheel, and the Shalems would
probably have their little day and then a long afternoon of diminishing
social importance; the placid dormouse-like Gr&auml;fin would outlast
them all.&nbsp; She had the qualities which make either for contented
mediocrity or else for very durable success, according as circumstances
may dictate.&nbsp; She was one of those characters that can neither
thrust themselves to the front, nor have any wish to do so, but being
there, no ordinary power can thrust them away.</p>
<p>With the Gr&auml;fin as her friend Cicely found herself in altogether
a different position from that involved by the mere interested patronage
of Lady Shalem.&nbsp; A vista of social success was opened up to her,
and she did not mean it to be just the ordinary success of a popular
and influential hostess moving in an important circle.&nbsp; That people
with naturally bad manners should have to be polite and considerate
in their dealings with her, that people who usually held themselves
aloof should have to be gracious and amiable, that the self-assured
should have to be just a little humble and anxious where she was concerned,
these things of course she intended to happen; she was a woman.&nbsp;
But, she told herself, she intended a great deal more than that when
she traced the pattern for her scheme of social influence.&nbsp; In
her heart she detested the German occupation as a hateful necessity,
but while her heart registered the hatefulness the brain recognised
the necessity.&nbsp; The great fighting-machines that the Germans had
built up and maintained, on land, on sea, and in air, were three solid
crushing facts that demonstrated the hopelessness of any immediate thought
of revolt.&nbsp; Twenty years hence, when the present generation was
older and greyer, the chances of armed revolt would probably be equally
hopeless, equally remote-seeming.&nbsp; But in the meantime something
could have been effected in another way.&nbsp; The conquerors might
partially Germanise London, but, on the other hand, if the thing were
skilfully managed, the British element within the Empire might impress
the mark of its influence on everything German.&nbsp; The fighting men
might remain Prussian or Bavarian, but the thinking men, and eventually
the ruling men, could gradually come under British influence, or even
be of British blood.&nbsp; An English Liberal-Conservative &ldquo;Centre&rdquo;
might stand as a bulwark against the Junkerdom and Socialism of Continental
Germany.&nbsp; So Cicely reasoned with herself, in a fashion induced
perhaps by an earlier apprenticeship to the reading of <i>Nineteenth</i>
<i>Century</i> articles, in which the possible political and racial
developments of various countries were examined and discussed and put
away in the pigeon-holes of probable happenings.&nbsp; She had sufficient
knowledge of political history to know that such a development might
possibly come to pass, she had not sufficient insight into actual conditions
to know that the possibility was as remote as that of armed resistance.&nbsp;
And the r&ocirc;le which she saw herself playing was that of a deft
and courtly political intriguer, rallying the British element and making
herself agreeable to the German element, a political inspiration to
the one and a social distraction to the other.&nbsp; At the back of
her mind there lurked an honest confession that she was probably over-rating
her powers of statecraft and personality, that she was more likely to
be carried along by the current of events than to control or divert
its direction; the political day-dream remained, however, as day-dreams
will, in spite of the clear light of probability shining through them.&nbsp;
At any rate she knew, as usual, what she wanted to do, and as usual
she had taken steps to carry out her intentions.&nbsp; Last night remained
in her mind a night of important victory.&nbsp; There also remained
the anxious proceeding of finding out if the victory had entailed any
serious losses.</p>
<p>Cicely was not one of those ill-regulated people who treat the first
meal of the day as a convenient occasion for serving up any differences
or contentions that have been left over from the day before or overlooked
in the press of other matters.&nbsp; She enjoyed her breakfast and gave
Yeovil unhindered opportunity for enjoying his; a discussion as to the
right cooking of a dish that he had first tasted among the Orenburg
Tartars was the prevailing topic on this particular morning, and blended
well with trout and toast and coffee.&nbsp; In a cosy nook of the smoking-room,
in participation of the after-breakfast cigarettes, Cicely made her
dash into debatable ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t asked me how my supper-party went off,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a notice of it in two of the morning papers, with
a list of those present,&rdquo; said Yeovil; &ldquo;the conquering race
seems to have been very well represented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several races were represented,&rdquo; said Cicely; &ldquo;a
function of that sort, celebrating a dramatic first-night, was bound
to be cosmopolitan.&nbsp; In fact, blending of races and nationalities
is the tendency of the age we live in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blending of races seems to have been consummated already
in one of the individuals at your party,&rdquo; said Yeovil drily; &ldquo;the
name Mentieth-Mendlesohnn struck me as a particularly happy obliteration
of racial landmarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A noisy and very wearisome sort of woman,&rdquo; she commented;
&ldquo;she reminds one of garlic that&rsquo;s been planted by mistake
in a conservatory.&nbsp; Still, she&rsquo;s useful as an advertising
agent to any one who rubs her the right way.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be invaluable
in proclaiming the merits of Gorla&rsquo;s performance to all and sundry;
that&rsquo;s why I invited her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll probably lunch to-day
at the Hotel Cecil, and every one sitting within a hundred yards of
her table will hear what an emotional education they can get by going
to see Gorla dance at the Caravansery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to be like the Salvation Army,&rdquo; said Yeovil;
&ldquo;her noise reaches a class of people who wouldn&rsquo;t trouble
to read press notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Cicely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gorla gets quite
good notices on the whole, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that took my fancy most was the one in the <i>Standard</i>,&rdquo;
said Yeovil, picking up that paper from a table by his side and searching
its columns for the notice in question.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;The wolves
which appeared earlier in the evening&rsquo;s entertainment are, the
programme assures us, trained entirely by kindness.&nbsp; It would have
been a further kindness, at any rate to the audience, if some of the
training, which the wolves doubtless do not appreciate at its proper
value, had been expended on Miss Mustelford&rsquo;s efforts at stage
dancing.&nbsp; We are assured, again on the authority of the programme,
that the much-talked-of Suggestion Dances are the last word in Posture
dancing.&nbsp; The last word belongs by immemorial right to the sex
which Miss Mustelford adorns, and it would be ungallant to seek to deprive
her of her privilege.&nbsp; As far as the educational aspect of her
performance is concerned we must admit that the life of the fern remains
to us a private life still.&nbsp; Miss Mustelford has abandoned her
own private life in an unavailing attempt to draw the fern into the
gaze of publicity.&nbsp; And so it was with her other suggestions.&nbsp;
They suggested many things, but nothing that was announced on the programme.&nbsp;
Chiefly they suggested one outstanding reflection, that stage-dancing
is not like those advertised breakfast foods that can be served up after
three minutes&rsquo; preparation.&nbsp; Half a life-time, or rather
half a youth-time is a much more satisfactory allowance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Standard</i> is prejudiced,&rdquo; said Cicely; &ldquo;some
of the other papers are quite enthusiastic.&nbsp; The <i>Dawn</i> gives
her a column and a quarter of notice, nearly all of it complimentary.&nbsp;
It says the report of her fame as a dancer went before her, but that
her performance last night caught it up and outstripped it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not like to suggest that the <i>Dawn</i> is prejudiced,&rdquo;
said Yeovil, &ldquo;but Shalem is a managing director on it, and one
of its biggest shareholders.&nbsp; Gorla&rsquo;s dancing is an event
of the social season, and Shalem is one of those most interested in
keeping up the appearance, at any rate, of a London social season.&nbsp;
Besides, her d&eacute;but gave the opportunity for an Imperial visit
to the theatre&mdash;the first appearance at a festive public function
of the Conqueror among the conquered.&nbsp; Apparently the experiment
passed off well; Shalem has every reason to feel pleased with himself
and well-disposed towards Gorla.&nbsp; By the way,&rdquo; added Yeovil,
&ldquo;talking of Gorla, I&rsquo;m going down to Torywood one day next
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Torywood?&rdquo; exclaimed Cicely.&nbsp; The tone of her
exclamation gave the impression that the announcement was not very acceptable
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised the old lady that I would go and have a talk with
her when I came back from my Siberian trip; she travelled in eastern
Russia, you know, long before the Trans-Siberian railway was built,
and she&rsquo;s enormously interested in those parts.&nbsp; In any case
I should like to see her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not see many people nowadays,&rdquo; said Cicely;
&ldquo;I fancy she is breaking up rather.&nbsp; She was very fond of
the son who went down, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has seen a great many of the things she cared for go down,&rdquo;
said Yeovil; &ldquo;it is a sad old life that is left to her, when one
thinks of all that the past has been to her, of the part she used to
play in the world, the work she used to get through.&nbsp; It used to
seem as though she could never grow old, as if she would die standing
up, with some unfinished command on her lips.&nbsp; And now I suppose
her tragedy is that she has grown old, bitterly old, and cannot die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely was silent for a moment, and seemed about to leave the room.&nbsp;
Then she turned back and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would say anything about Gorla to her
if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not have occurred to me to drag her name into our
conversation,&rdquo; said Yeovil coldly, &ldquo;but in any case the
accounts of her dancing performance will have reached Torywood through
the newspapers&mdash;also the record of your racially-blended supper-party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely said nothing.&nbsp; She knew that by last night&rsquo;s affair
she had definitely identified herself in public opinion with the Shalem
clique, and that many of her old friends would look on her with distrust
and suspicion on that account.&nbsp; It was unfortunate, but she reckoned
it a lesser evil than tearing herself away from her London life, its
successes and pleasures and possibilities.&nbsp; These social dislocations
and severing of friendships were to be looked for after any great and
violent change in State affairs.&nbsp; It was Yeovil&rsquo;s attitude
that really troubled her; she would not give way to his prejudices and
accept his point of view, but she knew that a victory that involved
estrangement from him would only bring a mockery of happiness.&nbsp;
She still hoped that he would come round to an acceptance of established
facts and deaden his political <i>malaise</i> in the absorbing distraction
of field sports.&nbsp; The visit to Torywood was a misfortune; it might
just turn the balance in the undesired direction.&nbsp; Only a few weeks
of late summer and early autumn remained before the hunting season,
and its preparations would be at hand, and Yeovil might be caught in
the meshes of an old enthusiasm; in those few weeks, however, he might
be fired by another sort of enthusiasm, an enthusiasm which would sooner
or later mean voluntary or enforced exile for his part, and the probable
breaking up of her own social plans and ambitions.</p>
<p>But Cicely knew something of the futility of improvising objections
where no real obstacle exists.&nbsp; The visit to Torywood was a graceful
attention on Yeovil&rsquo;s part to an old friend; there was no decent
ground on which it could be opposed.&nbsp; If the influence of that
visit came athwart Yeovil&rsquo;s life and hers with disastrous effect,
that was &ldquo;Kismet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once again the reek from her burned and smouldering boats mingled
threateningly with the incense fumes of her <i>Te</i> <i>Deum</i> for
victory.&nbsp; She left the room, and Yeovil turned once more to an
item of news in the morning&rsquo;s papers that had already arrested
his attention.&nbsp; The Imperial <i>Aufkl&auml;rung</i> on the subject
of military service was to be made public in the course of the day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI: THE TEA SHOP</h2>
<p>Yeovil wandered down Piccadilly that afternoon in a spirit of restlessness
and expectancy.&nbsp; The long-awaited <i>Aufkl&auml;rung</i> dealing
with the new law of military service had not yet appeared; at any moment
he might meet the hoarse-throated newsboys running along with their
papers, announcing the special edition which would give the terms of
the edict to the public.&nbsp; Every sound or movement that detached
itself with isolated significance from the general whirr and scurry
of the streets seemed to Yeovil to herald the oncoming clamour and rush
that he was looking for.&nbsp; But the long endless succession of motors
and &rsquo;buses and vans went by, hooting and grunting, and such newsboys
as were to be seen hung about listlessly, bearing no more attractive
bait on their posters than the announcement of an &ldquo;earthquake
shock in Hungary: feared loss of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Green Park end of Piccadilly was a changed, and in some respects
a livelier thoroughfare to that which Yeovil remembered with affectionate
regret.&nbsp; A great political club had migrated from its palatial
home to a shrunken habitation in a less prosperous quarter; its place
was filled by the flamboyant frontage of the Hotel Konstantinopel.&nbsp;
Gorgeous Turkey carpets were spread over the wide entrance steps, and
boys in Circassian and Anatolian costumes hung around the doors, or
dashed forth in un-Oriental haste to carry such messages as the telephone
was unable to transmit.&nbsp; Picturesque sellers of Turkish delight,
attar-of-roses, and brass-work coffee services, squatted under the portico,
on terms of obvious good understanding with the hotel management.&nbsp;
A few doors further down a service club that had long been a Piccadilly
landmark was a landmark still, as the home of the Army Aeronaut Club,
and there was a constant coming and going of gay-hued uniforms, Saxon,
Prussian, Bavarian, Hessian, and so forth, through its portals.&nbsp;
The mastering of the air and the creation of a scientific aerial war
fleet, second to none in the world, was an achievement of which the
conquering race was pardonably proud, and for which it had good reason
to be duly thankful.&nbsp; Over the gateways was blazoned the badge
of the club, an elephant, whale, and eagle, typifying the three armed
forces of the State, by land and sea and air; the eagle bore in its
beak a scroll with the proud legend: &ldquo;The last am I, but not the
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the eastward of this gaily-humming hive the long shuttered front
of a deserted ducal mansion struck a note of protest and mourning amid
the noise and whirl and colour of a seemingly uncaring city.&nbsp; On
the other side of the roadway, on the gravelled paths of the Green Park,
small ragged children from the back streets of Westminster looked wistfully
at the smooth trim stretches of grass on which it was now forbidden,
in two languages, to set foot.&nbsp; Only the pigeons, disregarding
the changes of political geography, walked about as usual, wondering
perhaps, if they ever wondered at anything, at the sudden change in
the distribution of park humans.</p>
<p>Yeovil turned his steps out of the hot sunlight into the shade of
the Burlington Arcade, familiarly known to many of its newer frequenters
as the Passage.&nbsp; Here the change that new conditions and requirements
had wrought was more immediately noticeable than anywhere else in the
West End.&nbsp; Most of the shops on the western side had been cleared
away, and in their place had been installed an &ldquo;open-air&rdquo;
caf&eacute;, converting the long alley into a sort of promenade tea-garden,
flanked on one side by a line of haberdashers&rsquo;, perfumers&rsquo;,
and jewellers&rsquo; show windows.&nbsp; The patrons of the caf&eacute;
could sit at the little round tables, drinking their coffee and syrups
and <i>ap&eacute;ritifs</i>, and gazing, if they were so minded, at
the pyjamas and cravats and Brazilian diamonds spread out for inspection
before them.&nbsp; A string orchestra, hidden away somewhere in a gallery,
was alternating grand opera with the <i>Gondola</i> <i>Girl</i> and
the latest gems of Transatlantic melody.&nbsp; From around the tightly-packed
tables arose a babble of tongues, made up chiefly of German, a South
American rendering of Spanish, and a North American rendering of English,
with here and there the sharp shaken-out staccato of Japanese.&nbsp;
A sleepy-looking boy, in a nondescript uniform, was wandering to and
fro among the customers, offering for sale the <i>Matin</i>, <i>New</i>
<i>York</i> <i>Herald</i>, <i>Berliner</i> <i>Tageblatt</i>, and a host
of crudely coloured illustrated papers, embodying the hard-worked wit
of a world-legion of comic artists.&nbsp; Yeovil hurried through the
Arcade; it was not here, in this atmosphere of staring alien eyes and
jangling tongues, that he wanted to read the news of the Imperial <i>Aufkl&auml;rung</i>.</p>
<p>By a succession of by-ways he reached Hanover Square, and thence
made his way into Oxford Street.&nbsp; There was no commotion of activity
to be noticed yet among the newsboys; the posters still concerned themselves
with the earthquake in Hungary, varied with references to the health
of the King of Roumania, and a motor accident in South London.&nbsp;
Yeovil wandered aimlessly along the street for a few dozen yards, and
then turned down into the smoking-room of a cheap tea-shop, where he
judged that the flourishing foreign element would be less conspicuously
represented.&nbsp; Quiet-voiced, smooth-headed youths, from neighbouring
shops and wholesale houses, sat drinking tea and munching pastry, some
of them reading, others making a fitful rattle with dominoes on the
marble-topped tables.&nbsp; A clean, wholesome smell of tea and coffee
made itself felt through the clouds of cigarette smoke; cleanliness
and listlessness seemed to be the dominant notes of the place, a cleanliness
that was commendable, and a listlessness that seemed unnatural and undesirable
where so much youth was gathered together for refreshment and recreation.&nbsp;
Yeovil seated himself at a table already occupied by a young clergyman
who was smoking a cigarette over the remains of a plateful of buttered
toast.&nbsp; He had a keen, clever, hard-lined face, the face of a man
who, in an earlier stage of European history, might have been a warlike
prior, awkward to tackle at the council-board, greatly to be avoided
where blows were being exchanged.&nbsp; A pale, silent damsel drifted
up to Yeovil and took his order with an air of being mentally some hundreds
of miles away, and utterly indifferent to the requirements of those
whom she served; if she had brought calf&rsquo;s-foot jelly instead
of the pot of China tea he had asked for, Yeovil would hardly have been
surprised.&nbsp; However, the tea duly arrived on the table, and the
pale damsel scribbled a figure on a slip of paper, put it silently by
the side of the teapot, and drifted silently away.&nbsp; Yeovil had
seen the same sort of thing done on the musical-comedy stage, and done
rather differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me, sir, is the Imperial announcement out yet?&rdquo;
asked the young clergyman, after a brief scrutiny of his neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have been waiting about for the last half-hour on the
look-out for it,&rdquo; said Yeovil; &ldquo;the special editions ought
to be out by now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added: &ldquo;I have only just
lately come from abroad.&nbsp; I know scarcely anything of London as
it is now.&nbsp; You may imagine that a good deal of it is very strange
to me.&nbsp; Your profession must take you a good deal among all classes
of people.&nbsp; I have seen something of what one may call the upper,
or, at any rate, the richer classes, since I came back; do tell me something
about the poorer classes of the community.&nbsp; How do they take the
new order of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badly,&rdquo; said the young cleric, &ldquo;badly, in more
senses than one.&nbsp; They are helpless and they are bitter&mdash;bitter
in the useless kind of way that produces no great resolutions.&nbsp;
They look round for some one to blame for what has happened; they blame
the politicians, they blame the leisured classes; in an indirect way
I believe they blame the Church.&nbsp; Certainly, the national disaster
has not drawn them towards religion in any form.&nbsp; One thing you
may be sure of, they do not blame themselves.&nbsp; No true Londoner
ever admits that fault lies at his door.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I never!&rsquo;
is an exclamation that is on his lips from earliest childhood, whenever
he is charged with anything blameworthy or punishable.&nbsp; That is
why school discipline was ever a thing repugnant to the schoolboard
child and its parents; no schoolboard scholar ever deserved punishment.&nbsp;
However obvious the fault might seem to a disciplinarian, &lsquo;No,
I never&rsquo; exonerated it as something that had not happened.&nbsp;
Public schoolboys and private schoolboys of the upper and middle class
had their fling and took their thrashings, when they were found out,
as a piece of bad luck, but &lsquo;our Bert&rsquo; and &lsquo;our Sid&rsquo;
were of those for whom there is no condemnation; if <i>they</i> were
punished it was for faults that &lsquo;no, they never&rsquo; committed.&nbsp;
Naturally the grown-up generation of Berts and Sids, the voters and
householders, do not realise, still less admit, that it was they who
called the tune to which the politicians danced.&nbsp; They had to choose
between the vote-mongers and the so-called &lsquo;scare-mongers,&rsquo;
and their verdict was for the vote-mongers all the time.&nbsp; And now
they are bitter; they are being punished, and punishment is not a thing
that they have been schooled to bear.&nbsp; The taxes that are falling
on them are a grievous source of discontent, and the military service
that will be imposed on them, for the first time in their lives, will
be another.&nbsp; There is a more lovable side to their character under
misfortune, though,&rdquo; added the young clergyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Deep
down in their hearts there was a very real affection for the old dynasty.&nbsp;
Future historians will perhaps be able to explain how and why the Royal
Family of Great Britain captured the imaginations of its subjects in
so genuine and lasting a fashion.&nbsp; Among the poorest and the most
matter-of-fact, for whom the name of no public man, politician or philanthropist,
stands out with any especial significance, the old Queen, and the dead
King, the dethroned monarch and the young prince live in a sort of domestic
Pantheon, a recollection that is a proud and wistful personal possession
when so little remains to be proud of or to possess.&nbsp; There is
no favour that I am so often asked for among my poorer parishioners
as the gift of the picture of this or that member of the old dynasty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have got all of them, only except Princess Mary,&rsquo; an
old woman said to me last week, and she nearly cried with pleasure when
I brought her an old <i>Bystander</i> portrait that filled the gap in
her collection.&nbsp; And on Queen Alexandra&rsquo;s day they bring
out and wear the faded wild-rose favours that they bought with their
pennies in days gone by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tragedy of the enactment that is about to enforce military
service on these people is that it comes when they&rsquo;ve no longer
a country to fight for,&rdquo; said Yeovil.</p>
<p>The young clergyman gave an exclamation of bitter impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the cruel mockery of the whole thing.&nbsp; Every
now and then in the course of my work I have come across lads who were
really drifting to the bad through the good qualities in them.&nbsp;
A clean combative strain in their blood, and a natural turn for adventure,
made the ordinary an&aelig;mic routine of shop or warehouse or factory
almost unbearable for them.&nbsp; What splendid little soldiers they
would have made, and how grandly the discipline of a military training
would have steadied them in after-life when steadiness was wanted.&nbsp;
The only adventure that their surroundings offered them has been the
adventure of practising mildly criminal misdeeds without getting landed
in reformatories and prisons; those of them that have not been successful
in keeping clear of detection are walking round and round prison yards,
experiencing the operation of a discipline that breaks and does not
build.&nbsp; They were merry-hearted boys once, with nothing of the
criminal or ne&rsquo;er-do-weel in their natures, and now&mdash;have
you ever seen a prison yard, with that walk round and round and round
between grey walls under a blue sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for criminals and imbeciles,&rdquo;
said the parson, &ldquo;but think of it for those boys, who might have
been marching along to the tap of the drum, with a laugh on their lips
instead of Hell in their hearts.&nbsp; I have had Hell in my heart sometimes,
when I have come in touch with cases like those.&nbsp; I suppose you
are thinking that I am a strange sort of parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just defining you in my mind,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;as
a man of God, with an infinite tenderness for little devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clergyman flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a fine epitaph to have on one&rsquo;s tombstone,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;especially if the tombstone were in some crowded city
graveyard.&nbsp; I suppose I am a man of God, but I don&rsquo;t think
I could be called a man of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the strong young face, with its suggestion of a fighting
prior of bygone days more marked than ever, Yeovil mentally agreed that
he could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned one thing in life,&rdquo; continued the young
man, &ldquo;and that is that peace is not for this world.&nbsp; Peace
is what God gives us when He takes us into His rest.&nbsp; Beat your
sword into a ploughshare if you like, but beat your enemy into smithereens
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long-drawn cry, repeated again and again, detached itself from
the throb and hoot and whir of the street traffic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speshul!&nbsp; Military service, spesh-ul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young clergyman sprang from his seat and went up the staircase
in a succession of bounds, causing the domino players and novelette
readers to look up for a moment in mild astonishment.&nbsp; In a few
seconds he was back again, with a copy of an afternoon paper.&nbsp;
The Imperial Rescript was set forth in heavy type, in parallel columns
of English and German.&nbsp; As the young man read a deep burning flush
spread over his face, then ebbed away into a chalky whiteness.&nbsp;
He read the announcement to the end, then handed the paper to Yeovil,
and left without a word.</p>
<p>Beneath the courtly politeness and benignant phraseology of the document
ran a trenchant searing irony.&nbsp; The British born subjects of the
Germanic Crown, inhabiting the islands of Great Britain and Ireland,
had habituated themselves as a people to the disuse of arms, and resolutely
excluded military service and national training from their political
system and daily life.&nbsp; Their judgment that they were unsuited
as a race to bear arms and conform to military discipline was not to
be set aside.&nbsp; Their new Overlord did not propose to do violence
to their feelings and customs by requiring from them the personal military
sacrifices and services which were rendered by his subjects German-born.&nbsp;
The British subjects of the Crown were to remain a people consecrated
to peaceful pursuits, to commerce and trade and husbandry.&nbsp; The
defence of their coasts and shipping and the maintenance of order and
general safety would be guaranteed by a garrison of German troops, with
the co-operation of the Imperial war fleet.&nbsp; German-born subjects
residing temporarily or permanently in the British Isles would come
under the same laws respecting compulsory military service as their
fellow-subjects of German blood in the other parts of the Empire, and
special enactments would be drawn up to ensure that their interests
did not suffer from a periodical withdrawal on training or other military
calls.&nbsp; Necessarily a heavily differentiated scale of war taxation
would fall on British taxpayers, to provide for the upkeep of the garrison
and to equalise the services and sacrifices rendered by the two branches
of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; As military service was not henceforth
open to any subject of British birth no further necessity for any training
or exercise of a military nature existed, therefore all rifle clubs,
drill associations, cadet corps and similar bodies were henceforth declared
to be illegal.&nbsp; No weapons other than guns for specified sporting
purposes, duly declared and registered and open to inspection when required,
could be owned, purchased, or carried.&nbsp; The science of arms was
to be eliminated altogether from the life of a people who had shown
such marked repugnance to its study and practice.</p>
<p>The cold irony of the measure struck home with the greater force
because its nature was so utterly unexpected.&nbsp; Public anticipation
had guessed at various forms of military service, aggressively irksome
or tactfully lightened as the case might be, in any event certain to
be bitterly unpopular, and now there had come this contemptuous boon,
which had removed, at one stroke, the bogey of compulsory military service
from the troubled imaginings of the British people, and fastened on
them the cruel distinction of being in actual fact what an enemy had
called them in splenetic scorn long years ago&mdash;a nation of shopkeepers.&nbsp;
Aye, something even below that level, a race of shopkeepers who were
no longer a nation.</p>
<p>Yeovil crumpled the paper in his hand and went out into the sunlit
street.&nbsp; A sudden roll of drums and crash of brass music filled
the air.&nbsp; A company of Bavarian infantry went by, in all the pomp
and circumstance of martial array and the joyous swing of rapid rhythmic
movement.&nbsp; The street echoed and throbbed in the Englishman&rsquo;s
ears with the exultant pulse of youth and mastery set to loud Pagan
music.&nbsp; A group of lads from the tea-shop clustered on the pavement
and watched the troops go by, staring at a phase of life in which they
had no share.&nbsp; The martial trappings, the swaggering joy of life,
the comradeship of camp and barracks, the hard discipline of drill yard
and fatigue duty, the long sentry watches, the trench digging, forced
marches, wounds, cold, hunger, makeshift hospitals, and the blood-wet
laurels&mdash;these were not for them.&nbsp; Such things they might
only guess at, or see on a cinema film, darkly; they belonged to the
civilian nation.</p>
<p>The function of afternoon tea was still being languidly observed
in the big drawing-room when Yeovil returned to Berkshire Street.&nbsp;
Cicely was playing the part of hostess to a man of perhaps forty-one
years of age, who looked slightly older from his palpable attempts to
look very much younger.&nbsp; Percival Plarsey was a plump, pale-faced,
short-legged individual, with puffy cheeks, over-prominent nose, and
thin colourless hair.&nbsp; His mother, with nothing more than maternal
prejudice to excuse her, had discovered some twenty odd years ago that
he was a well-favoured young man, and had easily imbued her son with
the same opinion.&nbsp; The slipping away of years and the natural transition
of the unathletic boy into the podgy unhealthy-looking man did little
to weaken the tradition; Plarsey had never been able to relinquish the
idea that a youthful charm and comeliness still centred in his person,
and laboured daily at his toilet with the devotion that a hopelessly
lost cause is so often able to inspire.&nbsp; He babbled incessantly
about himself and the accessory futilities of his life in short, neat,
complacent sentences, and in a voice that Ronald Storre said reminded
one of a fat bishop blessing a butter-making competition.&nbsp; While
he babbled he kept his eyes fastened on his listeners to observe the
impression which his important little announcements and pronouncements
were making.&nbsp; On the present occasion he was pattering forth a
detailed description of the upholstery and fittings of his new music-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the hangings, <i>violette</i> <i>de</i> <i>Parme</i>,
all the furniture, rosewood.&nbsp; The only ornament in the room is
a <i>replica</i> of the Mozart statue in Vienna.&nbsp; Nothing but Mozart
is to be played in the room.&nbsp; Absolutely, nothing but Mozart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get rather tired of that, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
said Cicely, feeling that she was expected to comment on this tremendous
announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One gets tired of everything,&rdquo; said Plarsey, with a
fat little sigh of resignation. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you <i>how</i>
tired I am of Rubenstein, and one day I suppose I shall be tired of
Mozart, and <i>violette</i> <i>de</i> <i>Parme</i> and rosewood.&nbsp;
I never thought it possible that I could ever tire of jonquils, and
now I simply won&rsquo;t have one in the house.&nbsp; Oh, the scene
the other day because some one brought some jonquils into the house!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid I was dreadfully rude, but I really couldn&rsquo;t
help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could talk like this through a long summer day or a long winter
evening.</p>
<p>Yeovil belonged to a race forbidden to bear arms.&nbsp; At the moment
he would gladly have contented himself with the weapons with which nature
had endowed him, if he might have kicked and pommelled the abhorrent
specimen of male humanity whom he saw before him.</p>
<p>Instead he broke into the conversation with an inspired flash of
malicious untruthfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; he observed carelessly, &ldquo;how
popular that Viennese statue of Mozart has become.&nbsp; A friend who
inspects County Council Art Schools tells me you find a copy of it in
every class-room you go into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a poor substitute for physical violence, but it was all that
civilisation allowed him in the way of relieving his feelings; it had,
moreover, the effect of making Plarsey profoundly miserable.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII: THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>The train bearing Yeovil on his visit to Torywood slid and rattled
westward through the hazy dreamland of an English summer landscape.&nbsp;
Seen from the train windows the stark bare ugliness of the metalled
line was forgotten, and the eye rested only on the green solitude that
unfolded itself as the miles went slipping by.&nbsp; Tall grasses and
meadow-weeds stood in deep shocks, field after field, between the leafy
boundaries of hedge or coppice, thrusting themselves higher and higher
till they touched the low sweeping branches of the trees that here and
there overshadowed them.&nbsp; Broad streams, bordered with a heavy
fringe of reed and sedge, went winding away into a green distance where
woodland and meadowland seemed indefinitely prolonged; narrow streamlets,
lost to view in the growth that they fostered, disclosed their presence
merely by the water-weed that showed in a riband of rank verdure threading
the mellower green of the fields.&nbsp; On the stream banks moorhens
walked with jerky confident steps, in the easy boldness of those who
had a couple of other elements at their disposal in an emergency; more
timorous partridges raced away from the apparition of the train, looking
all leg and neck, like little forest elves fleeing from human encounter.&nbsp;
And in the distance, over the tree line, a heron or two flapped with
slow measured wing-beats and an air of being bent on an immeasurably
longer journey than the train that hurtled so frantically along the
rails.&nbsp; Now and then the meadowland changed itself suddenly into
orchard, with close-growing trees already showing the measure of their
coming harvest, and then strawyard and farm buildings would slide into
view; heavy dairy cattle, roan and skewbald and dappled, stood near
the gates, drowsily resentful of insect stings, and bunched-up companies
of ducks halted in seeming irresolution between the charms of the horse-pond
and the alluring neighbourhood of the farm kitchen.&nbsp; Away by the
banks of some rushing mill-stream, in a setting of copse and cornfield,
a village might be guessed at, just a hint of red roof, grey wreathed
chimney and old church tower as seen from the windows of the passing
train, and over it all brooded a happy, settled calm, like the dreaming
murmur of a trout-stream and the far-away cawing of rooks.</p>
<p>It was a land where it seemed as if it must be always summer and
generally afternoon, a land where bees hummed among the wild thyme and
in the flower beds of cottage gardens, where the harvest-mice rustled
amid the corn and nettles, and the mill-race flowed cool and silent
through water-weeds and dark tunnelled sluices, and made soft droning
music with the wooden mill-wheel.&nbsp; And the music carried with it
the wording of old undying rhymes, and sang of the jolly, uncaring,
uncared-for miller, of the farmer who went riding upon his grey mare,
of the mouse who lived beneath the merry mill-pin, of the sweet music
on yonder green hill and the dancers all in yellow&mdash;the songs and
fancies of a lingering olden time, when men took life as children take
a long summer day, and went to bed at last with a simple trust in something
they could not have explained.</p>
<p>Yeovil watched the passing landscape with the intent hungry eyes
of a man who revisits a scene that holds high place in his affections.&nbsp;
His imagination raced even quicker than the train, following winding
roads and twisting valleys into unseen distances, picturing farms and
hamlets, hills and hollows, clattering inn yards and sleepy woodlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful country,&rdquo; said his only fellow-traveller,
who was also gazing at the fleeting landscape; &ldquo;surely a country
worth fighting for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in fairly correct English, but he was unmistakably a foreigner;
one could have allotted him with some certainty to the Eastern half
of Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful country, as you say,&rdquo; replied Yeovil; then
he added the question, &ldquo;Are you German?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Hungarian,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;and you, you
are English?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been much in England, but I am from Russia,&rdquo;
said Yeovil, purposely misleading his companion on the subject of his
nationality in order to induce him to talk with greater freedom on a
delicate topic.&nbsp; While living among foreigners in a foreign land
he had shrunk from hearing his country&rsquo;s disaster discussed, or
even alluded to; now he was anxious to learn what unprejudiced foreigners
thought of the catastrophe and the causes which had led up to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange spectacle, a wonder, is it not so?&rdquo;
resumed the other, &ldquo;a great nation such as this was, one of the
greatest nations in modern times, or of any time, carrying its flag
and its language into all parts of the world, and now, after one short
campaign, it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he shrugged his shoulders many times and made clucking noises
at the roof of his voice, like a hen calling to a brood of roving chickens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They grew soft,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;great world-commerce
brings great luxury, and luxury brings softness.&nbsp; They had everything
to warn them, things happening in their own time and before their eyes,
and they would not be warned.&nbsp; They had seen, in one generation,
the rise of the military and naval power of the Japanese, a brown-skinned
race living in some island rice fields in a tropical sea, a people one
thought of in connection with paper fans and flowers and pretty tea-gardens,
who suddenly marched and sailed into the world&rsquo;s gaze as a Great
Power; they had seen, too, the rise of the Bulgars, a poor herd of <i>zaptieh</i>-ridden
peasants, with a few students scattered in exile in Bukarest and Odessa,
who shot up in one generation to be an armed and aggressive nation with
history in its hands.&nbsp; The English saw these things happening around
them, and with a war-cloud growing blacker and bigger and always more
threatening on their own threshold they sat down to grow soft and peaceful.&nbsp;
They grew soft and accommodating in all things in religion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In religion?&rdquo; said Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In religion, yes,&rdquo; said his companion emphatically;
&ldquo;they had come to look on the Christ as a sort of amiable elder
Brother, whose letters from abroad were worth reading.&nbsp; Then, when
they had emptied all the divine mystery and wonder out of their faith
naturally they grew tired of it, oh, but dreadfully tired of it.&nbsp;
I know many English of the country parts, and always they tell me they
go to church once in each week to set the good example to the servants.&nbsp;
They were tired of their faith, but they were not virile enough to become
real Pagans; their dancing fauns were good young men who tripped Morris
dances and ate health foods and believed in a sort of Socialism which
made for the greatest dulness of the greatest number.&nbsp; You will
find plenty of them still if you go into what remains of social London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil gave a grunt of acquiescence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They grew soft in their political ideas,&rdquo; continued
the unsparing critic; &ldquo;for the old insular belief that all foreigners
were devils and rogues they substituted another belief, equally grounded
on insular lack of knowledge, that most foreigners were amiable, good
fellows, who only needed to be talked to and patted on the back to become
your friends and benefactors.&nbsp; They began to believe that a foreign
Minister would relinquish long-cherished schemes of national policy
and hostile expansion if he came over on a holiday and was asked down
to country houses and shown the tennis court and the rock-garden and
the younger children.&nbsp; Listen.&nbsp; I once heard it solemnly stated
at an after-dinner debate in some literary club that a certain very
prominent German statesman had a daughter at school in England, and
that future friendly relations between the two countries were improved
in prospect, if not assured, by that circumstance.&nbsp; You think I
am laughing; I am recording a fact, and the men present were politicians
and statesmen as well as literary dilettanti.&nbsp; It was an insular
lack of insight that worked the mischief, or some of the mischief.&nbsp;
We, in Hungary, we live too much cheek by jowl with our racial neighbours
to have many illusions about them.&nbsp; Austrians, Roumanians, Serbs,
Italians, Czechs, we know what they think of us, and we know what to
think of them, we know what we want in the world, and we know what they
want; that knowledge does not send us flying at each other&rsquo;s throats,
but it does keep us from growing soft.&nbsp; Ah, the British lion was
in a hurry to inaugurate the Millennium and to lie down gracefully with
the lamb.&nbsp; He made two mistakes, only two, but they were very bad
ones; the Millennium hadn&rsquo;t arrived, and it was not a lamb that
he was lying down with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not like the English, I gather,&rdquo; said Yeovil,
as the Hungarian went off into a short burst of satirical laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always liked them,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but now
I am angry with them for being soft.&nbsp; Here is my station,&rdquo;
he added, as the train slowed down, and he commenced to gather his belongings
together.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am angry with them,&rdquo; he continued, as
a final word on the subject, &ldquo;because I <i>hate</i> the Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hat punctiliously in a parting salute and stepped out
on to the platform.&nbsp; His place was taken by a large, loose-limbed
man, with florid face and big staring eyes, and an immense array of
fishing-basket, rod, fly-cases, and so forth.&nbsp; He was of the type
that one could instinctively locate as a loud-voiced, self-constituted
authority on whatever topic might happen to be discussed in the bars
of small hotels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you English?&rdquo; he asked, after a preliminary stare
at Yeovil.</p>
<p>This time Yeovil did not trouble to disguise his nationality; he
nodded curtly to his questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad of that,&rdquo; said the fisherman; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like travelling with Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;we have to travel
with them, as partners in the same State concern, and not by any means
the predominant partner either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will soon right itself,&rdquo; said the other with
loud assertiveness, &ldquo;that will right itself damn soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in politics rights itself,&rdquo; said Yeovil; &ldquo;things
have to be righted, which is a different matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;mean?&rdquo; said the fisherman, who
did not like to have his assertions taken up and shaken into shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have given a clever and domineering people a chance to
plant themselves down as masters in our land; I don&rsquo;t imagine
that they are going to give us an easy chance to push them out.&nbsp;
To do that we shall have to be a little cleverer than they are, a little
harder, a little fiercer, and a good deal more self-sacrificing than
we have been in my lifetime or in yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be that, right enough,&rdquo; said the fisherman;
&ldquo;we mean business this time.&nbsp; The last war wasn&rsquo;t a
war, it was a snap.&nbsp; We weren&rsquo;t prepared and they were.&nbsp;
That won&rsquo;t happen again, bless you.&nbsp; I know what I&rsquo;m
talking about.&nbsp; I go up and down the country, and I hear what people
are saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil privately doubted if he ever heard anything but his own opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands to reason,&rdquo; continued the fisherman, &ldquo;that
a highly civilised race like ours, with the record that we&rsquo;ve
had for leading the whole world, is not going to be held under for long
by a lot of damned sausage-eating Germans.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe
it!&nbsp; I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve travelled
about the world a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil shrewdly suspected that the world travels amounted to nothing
more than a trip to the United States and perhaps the Channel Islands,
with, possibly, a week or fortnight in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the past we&rsquo;ve got to think of, it&rsquo;s
the future,&rdquo; said Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other maritime Powers had
pasts to look back on; Spain and Holland, for instance.&nbsp; The past
didn&rsquo;t help them when they let their sea-sovereignty slip from
them.&nbsp; That is a matter of history and not very distant history
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s where you make a mistake,&rdquo; said the
other; &ldquo;our sea-sovereignty hasn&rsquo;t slipped from us, and
won&rsquo;t do, neither.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the British Empire beyond
the seas; Canada, Australia, New Zealand, East Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled the names round his tongue with obvious relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was a list of first-class battleships, and armoured
cruisers and destroyers and airships that you were reeling off, there
would be some comfort and hope in the situation,&rdquo; said Yeovil;
&ldquo;the loyalty of the colonies is a splendid thing, but it is only
pathetically splendid because it can do so little to recover for us
what we&rsquo;ve lost.&nbsp; Against the Zeppelin air fleet, and the
Dreadnought sea squadrons and the new Gelberhaus cruisers, the last
word in maritime mobility, of what avail is loyal devotion plus half-a-dozen
warships, one keel to ten, scattered over one or two ocean coasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but they&rsquo;ll build,&rdquo; said the fisherman confidently;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll build.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re only waiting to enlarge
their dockyard accommodation and get the right class of artificers and
engineers and workmen together.&nbsp; The money will be forthcoming
somehow, and they&rsquo;ll start in and build.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you suppose,&rdquo; asked Yeovil in slow bitter contempt,
&ldquo;that the victorious nation is going to sit and watch and wait
till the defeated foe has created a new war fleet, big enough to drive
it from the seas?&nbsp; Do you suppose it is going to watch keel added
to keel, gun to gun, airship to airship, till its preponderance has
been wiped out or even threatened?&nbsp; That sort of thing is done
once in a generation, not twice.&nbsp; Who is going to protect Australia
or New Zealand while they enlarge their dockyards and hangars and build
their dreadnoughts and their airships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my station and I&rsquo;m not sorry,&rdquo; said
the fisherman, gathering his tackle together and rising to depart; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
listened to you long enough.&nbsp; You and me wouldn&rsquo;t agree,
not if we was to talk all day.&nbsp; Fact is, I&rsquo;m an out-and-out
patriot and you&rsquo;re only a half-hearted one.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what you are, half-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that parting shot he left the carriage and lounged heavily
down the platform, a patriot who had never handled a rifle or mounted
a horse or pulled an oar, but who had never flinched from demolishing
his country&rsquo;s enemies with his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;England has never had any lack of patriots of that type,&rdquo;
thought Yeovil sadly; &ldquo;so many patriots and so little patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII: TORYWOOD</h2>
<p>Yeovil got out of the train at a small, clean, wayside station, and
rapidly formed the conclusion that neatness, abundant leisure, and a
devotion to the cultivation of wallflowers and wyandottes were the prevailing
influences of the station-master&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The train slid
away into the hazy distance of trees and meadows, and left the traveller
standing in a world that seemed to be made up in equal parts of rock
garden, chicken coops, and whiskey advertisements.&nbsp; The station-master,
who appeared also to act as emergency porter, took Yeovil&rsquo;s ticket
with the gesture of a kind-hearted person brushing away a troublesome
wasp, and returned to a study of the <i>Poultry</i> <i>Chronicle</i>,
which was giving its readers sage counsel concerning the ailments of
belated July chickens.&nbsp; Yeovil called to mind the station-master
of a tiny railway town in Siberia, who had held him in long and rather
intelligent converse on the poetical merits and demerits of Shelley,
and he wondered what the result would be if he were to engage the English
official in a discussion on Lermontoff&mdash;or for the matter of that,
on Shelley.&nbsp; The temptation to experiment was, however, removed
by the arrival of a young groom, with brown eyes and a friendly smile,
who hurried into the station and took Yeovil once more into a world
where he was of fleeting importance.</p>
<p>In the roadway outside was a four-wheeled dogcart with a pair of
the famous Torywood blue roans.&nbsp; It was an agreeable variation
in modern locomotion to be met at a station with high-class horseflesh
instead of the ubiquitous motor, and the landscape was not of such a
nature that one wished to be whirled through it in a cloud of dust.&nbsp;
After a quick spin of some ten or fifteen minutes through twisting hedge-girt
country roads, the roans turned in at a wide gateway, and went with
dancing, rhythmic step along the park drive.&nbsp; The screen of oak-crowned
upland suddenly fell away and a grey sharp-cornered building came into
view in a setting of low growing beeches and dark pines.&nbsp; Torywood
was not a stately, reposeful-looking house; it lay amid the sleepy landscape
like a couched watchdog with pricked ears and wakeful eyes.&nbsp; Built
somewhere about the last years of Dutch William&rsquo;s reign, it had
been a centre, ever since, for the political life of the countryside;
a storm centre of discontent or a rallying ground for the well affected,
as the circumstances of the day might entail.&nbsp; On the stone-flagged
terrace in front of the house, with its quaint leaden figures of Diana
pursuing a hound-pressed stag, successive squires and lords of Torywood
had walked to and fro with their friends, watching the thunderclouds
on the political horizon or the shifting shadows on the sundial of political
favour, tapping the political barometer for indications of change, working
out a party campaign or arranging for the support of some national movement.&nbsp;
To and fro they had gone in their respective generations, men with the
passion for statecraft and political combat strong in their veins, and
many oft-recurring names had echoed under those wakeful-looking casements,
names spoken in anger or exultation, or murmured in fear and anxiety:
Bolingbroke, Charles Edward, Walpole, the Farmer King, Bonaparte, Pitt,
Wellington, Peel, Gladstone&mdash;echo and Time might have graven those
names on the stone flags and grey walls.&nbsp; And now one tired old
woman walked there, with names on her lips that she never uttered.</p>
<p>A friendly riot of fox terriers and spaniels greeted the carriage,
leaping and rolling and yelping in an exuberance of sociability, as
though horses and coachman and groom were comrades who had been absent
for long months instead of half an hour.&nbsp; An indiscriminately affectionate
puppy lay flat and whimpering at Yeovil&rsquo;s feet, sending up little
showers of gravel with its wildly thumping tail, while two of the terriers
raced each other madly across lawn and shrubbery, as though to show
the blue roans what speed really was.&nbsp; The laughing-eyed young
groom disentangled the puppy from between Yeovil&rsquo;s legs, and then
he was ushered into the grey silence of the entrance hall, leaving sunlight
and noise and the stir of life behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship will see you in her writing room,&rdquo; he was
told, and he followed a servant along the dark passages to the well-remembered
room.</p>
<p>There was something tragic in the sudden contrast between the vigour
and youth and pride of life that Yeovil had seen crystallised in those
dancing, high-stepping horses, scampering dogs, and alert, clean-limbed
young men-servants, and the age-frail woman who came forward to meet
him.</p>
<p>Eleanor, Dowager Lady Greymarten, had for more than half a century
been the ruling spirit at Torywood.&nbsp; The affairs of the county
had not sufficed for her untiring activities of mind and body; in the
wider field of national and Imperial service she had worked and schemed
and fought with an energy and a far-sightedness that came probably from
the blend of caution and bold restlessness in her Scottish blood.&nbsp;
For many educated minds the arena of politics and public life is a weariness
of dust and disgust, to others it is a fascinating study, to be watched
from the comfortable seat of a spectator.&nbsp; To her it was a home.&nbsp;
In her town house or down at Torywood, with her writing-pad on her knee
and the telephone at her elbow, or in personal counsel with some trusted
colleague or persuasive argument with a halting adherent or half-convinced
opponent, she had laboured on behalf of the poor and the ill-equipped,
had fought for her idea of the Right, and above all, for the safety
and sanity of her Fatherland.&nbsp; Spadework when necessary and leadership
when called for, came alike within the scope of her activities, and
not least of her achievements, though perhaps she hardly realised it,
was the force of her example, a lone, indomitable fighter calling to
the half-caring and the half-discouraged, to the laggard and the slow-moving.</p>
<p>And now she came across the room with &ldquo;the tired step of a
tired king,&rdquo; and that look which the French so expressively called
<i>l&rsquo;air</i> <i>d&eacute;fait</i>.&nbsp; The charm which Heaven
bestows on old ladies, reserving its highest gift to the end, had always
seemed in her case to be lost sight of in the dignity and interest of
a great dame who was still in the full prime of her fighting and ruling
powers.&nbsp; Now, in Yeovil&rsquo;s eyes, she had suddenly come to
be very old, stricken with the forlorn languor of one who knows that
death will be weary to wait for.&nbsp; She had spared herself nothing
in the long labour, the ceaseless building, the watch and ward, and
in one short autumn week she had seen the overthrow of all that she
had built, the falling asunder of the world in which she had laboured.&nbsp;
Her life&rsquo;s end was like a harvest home when blight and storm have
laid waste the fruit of long toil and unsparing outlay.&nbsp; Victory
had been her goal, the death or victory of old heroic challenge, for
she had always dreamed to die fighting to the last; death or victory&mdash;and
the gods had given her neither, only the bitterness of a defeat that
could not be measured in words, and the weariness of a life that had
outlived happiness or hope.&nbsp; Such was Eleanor, Dowager Lady Greymarten,
a shadow amid the young red-blooded life at Torywood, but a shadow that
was too real to die, a shadow that was stronger than the substance that
surrounded it.</p>
<p>Yeovil talked long and hurriedly of his late travels, of the vast
Siberian forests and rivers, the desolate tundras, the lakes and marshes
where the wild swans rear their broods, the flower carpet of the summer
fields and the winter ice-mantle of Russia&rsquo;s northern sea.&nbsp;
He talked as a man talks who avoids the subject that is uppermost in
his mind, and in the mind of his hearer, as one who looks away from
a wound or deformity that is too cruel to be taken notice of.</p>
<p>Tea was served in a long oak-panelled gallery, where generations
of Mustelfords had romped and played as children, and remained yet in
effigy, in a collection of more or less faithful portraits.&nbsp; After
tea Yeovil was taken by his hostess to the aviaries, which constituted
the sole claim which Torywood possessed to being considered a show place.&nbsp;
The third Earl of Greymarten had collected rare and interesting birds,
somewhere about the time when Gilbert White was penning the last of
his deathless letters, and his successors in the title had perpetuated
the hobby.&nbsp; Little lawns and ponds and shrubberies were partitioned
off for the various ground-loving species, and higher cages with interlacing
perches and rockwork shelves accommodated the birds whose natural expression
of movement was on the wing.&nbsp; Quails and francolins scurried about
under low-growing shrubs, peacock-pheasants strutted and sunned themselves,
pugnacious ruffs engaged in perfunctory battles, from force of habit
now that the rivalry of the mating season was over; choughs, ravens,
and loud-throated gulls occupied sections of a vast rockery, and bright-hued
Chinese pond-herons and delicately stepping egrets waded among the waterlilies
of a marble-terraced tank.&nbsp; One or two dusky shapes seen dimly
in the recesses of a large cage built round a hollow tree would be lively
owls when evening came on.</p>
<p>In the course of his many wanderings Yeovil had himself contributed
three or four inhabitants to this little feathered town, and he went
round the enclosures, renewing old acquaintances and examining new additions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The falcon cage is empty,&rdquo; said Lady Greymarten, pointing
to a large wired dome that towered high above the other enclosures,
&ldquo;I let the lanner fly free one day.&nbsp; The other birds may
be reconciled to their comfortable quarters and abundant food and absence
of dangers, but I don&rsquo;t think all those things could make up to
a falcon for the wild range of cliff and desert.&nbsp; When one has
lost one&rsquo;s own liberty one feels a quicker sympathy for other
caged things, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, and then the Dowager went on, in
a wistful, passionate voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an old woman now, Murrey, I must die in my cage.&nbsp;
I haven&rsquo;t the strength to fight.&nbsp; Age is a very real and
very cruel thing, though we may shut our eyes to it and pretend it is
not there.&nbsp; I thought at one time that I should never really know
what it meant, what it brought to one.&nbsp; I thought of it as a messenger
that one could keep waiting out in the yard till the very last moment.&nbsp;
I know now what it means. . . .&nbsp; But you, Murrey, you are young,
you can fight.&nbsp; Are you going to be a fighter, or the very humble
servant of the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never be the servant of the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>,&rdquo;
said Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I loathe it.&nbsp; As to fighting, one must
first find out what weapon to use, and how to use it effectively.&nbsp;
One must watch and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must not wait too long,&rdquo; said the old woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Time is on their side, not ours.&nbsp; It is the young people
we must fight for now, if they are ever to fight for us.&nbsp; A new
generation will spring up, a weaker memory of old glories will survive,
the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of the ruling race will capture young imaginations.&nbsp;
If I had your youth, Murrey, and your sex, I would become a commercial
traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A commercial traveller!&rdquo; exclaimed Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one whose business took him up and down the country,
into contact with all classes, into homes and shops and inns and railway
carriages.&nbsp; And as I travelled I would work, work on the minds
of every boy and girl I came across, every young father and young mother
too, every young couple that were going to be man and wife.&nbsp; I
would awaken or keep alive in their memory the things that we have been,
the grand, brave things that some of our race have done, and I would
stir up a longing, a determination for the future that we must win back.&nbsp;
I would be a counter-agent to the agents of the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&nbsp;
In course of time the Government would find out what I was doing, and
I should be sent out of the country, but I should have accomplished
something, and others would carry on the work.&nbsp; That is what I
would do.&nbsp; Murrey, even if it is to be a losing battle, fight it,
fight it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil knew that the old lady was fighting her last battle, rallying
the discouraged, and spurring on the backward.</p>
<p>A footman came to announce that the carriage waited to take him back
to the station.&nbsp; His hostess walked with him through the hall,
and came out on to the stone-flagged terrace, the terrace from which
a former Lady Greymarten had watched the twinkling bonfires that told
of Waterloo.</p>
<p>Yeovil said good-bye to her as she stood there, a wan, shrunken shadow,
yet with a greater strength and reality in her flickering life than
those parrot men and women that fluttered and chattered through London
drawing-rooms and theatre foyers.</p>
<p>As the carriage swung round a bend in the drive Yeovil looked back
at Torywood, a lone, grey building, couched like a watchdog with pricked
ears and wakeful eyes in the midst of the sleeping landscape.&nbsp;
An old pleading voice was still ringing in his ears:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Imperious</i> <i>and</i> <i>yet</i> <i>forlorn</i>,<br />
<i>Came</i> <i>through</i> <i>the</i> <i>silence</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i>
<i>trees</i>,<br />
<i>The</i> <i>echoes</i> <i>of</i> <i>a</i> <i>golden</i> <i>horn</i>,<br />
<i>Calling</i> <i>to</i> <i>distances</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow Yeovil knew that he would never hear that voice again, and
he knew, too, that he would hear it always, with its message, &ldquo;Be
a fighter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he knew now, with a shamefaced consciousness
that sprang suddenly into existence, that the summons would sound for
him in vain.</p>
<p>The weary brain-torturing months of fever had left their trail behind,
a lassitude of spirit and a sluggishness of blood, a quenching of the
desire to roam and court adventure and hardship.&nbsp; In the hours
of waking and depression between the raging intervals of delirium he
had speculated, with a sort of detached, listless indifference, on the
chances of his getting back to life and strength and energy.&nbsp; The
prospect of filling a corner of some lonely Siberian graveyard or Finnish
cemetery had seemed near realisation at times, and for a man who was
already half dead the other half didn&rsquo;t particularly matter.&nbsp;
But when he had allowed himself to dwell on the more hopeful side of
the case it had always been a complete recovery that awaited him; the
same Yeovil as of yore, a little thinner and more lined about the eyes
perhaps, would go through life in the same way, alert, resolute, enterprising,
ready to start off at short notice for some desert or upland where the
eagles were circling and the wild-fowl were calling.&nbsp; He had not
reckoned that Death, evaded and held off by the doctors&rsquo; skill,
might exact a compromise, and that only part of the man would go free
to the West.</p>
<p>And now he began to realise how little of mental and physical energy
he could count on.&nbsp; His own country had never seemed in his eyes
so comfort-yielding and to-be-desired as it did now when it had passed
into alien keeping and become a prison land as much as a homeland.&nbsp;
London with its thin mockery of a Season, and its chattering horde of
empty-hearted self-seekers, held no attraction for him, but the spell
of English country life was weaving itself round him, now that the charm
of the desert was receding into a mist of memories.&nbsp; The waning
of pleasant autumn days in an English woodland, the whir of game birds
in the clean harvested fields, the grey moist mornings in the saddle,
with the magical cry of hounds coming up from some misty hollow, and
then the delicious abandon of physical weariness in bathroom and bedroom
after a long run, and the heavenly snatched hour of luxurious sleep,
before stirring back to life and hunger, the coming of the dinner hour
and the jollity of a well-chosen house-party.</p>
<p>That was the call which was competing with that other trumpet-call,
and Yeovil knew on which side his choice would incline.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV: &ldquo;A PERFECTLY GLORIOUS AFTERNOON&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was one of the last days of July, cooled and freshened by a touch
of rain and dropping back again to a languorous warmth.&nbsp; London
looked at its summer best, rain-washed and sun-lit, with the maximum
of coming and going in its more fashionable streets.</p>
<p>Cicely Yeovil sat in a screened alcove of the Anchorage Restaurant,
a feeding-ground which had lately sprung into favour.&nbsp; Opposite
her sat Ronnie, confronting the ruins of what had been a dish of prawns
in aspic.&nbsp; Cool and clean and fresh-coloured, he was good to look
on in the eyes of his companion, and yet, perhaps, there was a ruffle
in her soul that called for some answering disturbance on the part of
that superbly tranquil young man, and certainly called in vain.&nbsp;
Cicely had set up for herself a fetish of onyx with eyes of jade, and
doubtless hungered at times with an unreasonable but perfectly natural
hunger for something of flesh and blood.&nbsp; It was the religion of
her life to know exactly what she wanted and to see that she got it,
but there was no possible guarantee against her occasionally experiencing
a desire for something else.&nbsp; It is the golden rule of all religions
that no one should really live up to their precepts; when a man observes
the principles of his religion too exactly he is in immediate danger
of founding a new sect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day is going to be your day of triumph,&rdquo; said Cicely
to the young man, who was wondering at the moment whether he would care
to embark on an artichoke; &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m more nervous than
you are,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and yet I rather hate the idea of
you scoring a great success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Ronnie, diverting his mind for a moment
from the artichoke question and its ramifications of <i>sauce</i> <i>hollandaise</i>
or <i>vinaigre</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you as you are,&rdquo; said Cicely, &ldquo;just a nice-looking
boy to flatter and spoil and pretend to be fond of.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
got a charming young body and you&rsquo;ve no soul, and that&rsquo;s
such a fascinating combination.&nbsp; If you had a soul you would either
dislike or worship me, and I&rsquo;d much rather have things as they
are.&nbsp; And now you are going to go a step beyond that, and other
people will applaud you and say that you are wonderful, and invite you
to eat with them and motor with them and yacht with them.&nbsp; As soon
as that begins to happen, Ronnie, a lot of other things will come to
an end.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;ve always known that you don&rsquo;t
really care for me, but as soon as the world knows it you are irrevocably
damaged as a plaything.&nbsp; That is the great secret that binds us
together, the knowledge that we have no real affection for one another.&nbsp;
And this afternoon every one will know that you are a great artist,
and no great artist was ever a great lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be difficult to replace, anyway,&rdquo; said
Ronnie, with what he imagined was a becoming modesty; &ldquo;there are
lots of boys standing round ready to be fed and flattered and put on
an imaginary pedestal, most of them more or less good-looking and well
turned out and amusing to talk to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say I could find a successor for your vacated niche,&rdquo;
said Cicely lightly; &ldquo;one thing I&rsquo;m determined on though,
he shan&rsquo;t be a musician.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so unsatisfactory to
have to share a grand passion with a grand piano.&nbsp; He shall be
a delightful young barbarian who would think Saint Sa&euml;ns was a
Derby winner or a claret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in too much of a hurry to replace me,&rdquo;
said Ronnie, who did not care to have his successor too seriously discussed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I may not score the success you expect this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, a minor crowned head from across the sea is coming
to hear you play, and that alone will count as a success with most of
your listeners.&nbsp; Also, I&rsquo;ve secured a real Duchess for you,
which is rather an achievement in the London of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An English Duchess?&rdquo; asked Ronnie, who had early in
life learned to apply the Merchandise Marks Act to ducal titles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;English, oh certainly, at least as far as the title goes;
she was born under the constellation of the Star-spangled Banner.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t suppose the Duke approves of her being here, lending her
countenance to the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>, but when you&rsquo;ve
got republican blood in your veins a Kaiser is quite as attractive a
lodestar as a King, rather more so.&nbsp; And Canon Mousepace is coming,&rdquo;
continued Cicely, referring to a closely-written list of guests; &ldquo;the
excellent von Tolb has been attending his church lately, and the Canon
is longing to meet her.&nbsp; She is just the sort of person he adores.&nbsp;
I fancy he sincerely realises how difficult it will be for the rich
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and he tries to make up for it by being
as nice as possible to them in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie held out his hand for the list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know most of the others,&rdquo; said Cicely, passing
it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leutnant von Gabelroth?&rdquo; read out Ronnie; &ldquo;who
is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the hussar regiments quartered here; a friend of
the Gr&auml;fin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ugly but amiable, and I&rsquo;m told
a good cross-country rider.&nbsp; I suppose Murrey will be disgusted
at meeting the &lsquo;outward and visible sign&rsquo; under his roof,
but these encounters are inevitable as long as he is in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Murrey was coming,&rdquo; said Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s going to look in on us,&rdquo; said Cicely;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just as well, you know, otherwise we should have Joan
asking in her loudest voice when he was going to be back in England
again.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t asked her, but she overheard the Gr&auml;fin
arranging to come and hear you play, and I fancy that will be quite
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about some Turkish coffee?&rdquo; said Ronnie, who had
decided against the artichoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turkish coffee, certainly, and a cigarette, and a moment&rsquo;s
peace before the serious business of the afternoon claims us.&nbsp;
Talking about peace, do you know, Ronnie, it has just occurred to me
that we have left out one of the most important things in our <i>affaire</i>;
we have never had a quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate quarrels,&rdquo; said Ronnie, &ldquo;they are so domesticated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard you talk
about your home,&rdquo; said Cicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy it would apply to most homes,&rdquo; said Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last boy-friend I had used to quarrel furiously with me
at least once a week,&rdquo; said Cicely reflectively; &ldquo;but then
he had dark slumberous eyes that lit up magnificently when he was angry,
so it would have been a sheer waste of God&rsquo;s good gifts not to
have sent him into a passion now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your excursions into the past and the future you are
making me feel dreadfully like an instalment of a serial novel,&rdquo;
protested Ronnie; &ldquo;we have now got to &lsquo;synopsis of earlier
chapters.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shan&rsquo;t be teased,&rdquo; said Cicely; &ldquo;we will
live in the present and go no further into the future than to make arrangements
for Tuesday&rsquo;s dinner-party.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve asked the Duchess;
she would never have forgiven me if she&rsquo;d found out that I had
a crowned head dining with me and hadn&rsquo;t asked her to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>A sudden hush descended on the company gathered in the great drawing-room
at Berkshire Street as Ronnie took his seat at the piano; the voice
of Canon Mousepace outlasted the others for a moment or so, and then
subsided into a regretful but gracious silence.&nbsp; For the next nine
or ten minutes Ronnie held possession of the crowded room, a tense slender
figure, with cold green eyes aflame in a sudden fire, and smooth burnished
head bent low over the keyboard that yielded a disciplined riot of melody
under his strong deft fingers.&nbsp; The world-weary Landgraf forgot
for the moment the regrettable trend of his subjects towards Parliamentary
Socialism, the excellent Gr&auml;fin von Tolb forgot all that the Canon
had been saying to her for the last ten minutes, forgot the depressing
certainty that he would have a great deal more that he wanted to say
in the immediate future, over and above the thirty-five minutes or so
of discourse that she would contract to listen to next Sunday.&nbsp;
And Cicely listened with the wistful equivocal triumph of one whose
goose has turned out to be a swan and who realises with secret concern
that she has only planned the r&ocirc;le of goosegirl for herself.</p>
<p>The last chords died away, the fire faded out of the jade-coloured
eyes, and Ronnie became once more a well-groomed youth in a drawing-room
full of well-dressed people.&nbsp; But around him rose an explosive
clamour of applause and congratulation, the sincere tribute of appreciation
and the equally hearty expression of imitative homage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great gift, a great gift,&rdquo; chanted Canon Mousepace,
&ldquo;You must put it to a great use.&nbsp; A talent is vouchsafed
to us for a purpose; you must fulfil the purpose.&nbsp; Talent such
as yours is a responsibility; you must meet that responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dictionary of the English language was an inexhaustible quarry,
from which the Canon had hewn and fashioned for himself a great reputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must gom and blay to me at Schlachsenberg,&rdquo; said
the kindly-faced Landgraf, whom the world adored and thwarted in about
equal proportions.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Christmas, yes, that will be a good
time.&nbsp; We still keep the Christ-Fest at Schlachsenberg, though
the &lsquo;Sozi&rsquo; keep telling our schoolchildren that it is only
a Christ myth.&nbsp; Never mind, I will have the Vice-President of our
Landtag to listen to you; he is &lsquo;Sozi&rsquo; but we are good friends
outside the Parliament House; you shall blay to him, my young friendt,
and gonfince him that there is a Got in Heaven.&nbsp; You will gom?&nbsp;
Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was beautiful,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin simply; &ldquo;it
made me cry.&nbsp; Go back to the piano again, please, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the near neighbourhood of the Canon inspired this command,
but the Gr&auml;fin had been genuinely charmed.&nbsp; She adored good
music and she was unaffectedly fond of good-looking boys.</p>
<p>Ronnie went back to the piano and tasted the matured pleasure of
a repeated success.&nbsp; Any measure of nervousness that he may have
felt at first had completely passed away.&nbsp; He was sure of his audience
and he played as though they did not exist.&nbsp; A renewed clamour
of excited approval attended the conclusion of his performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a triumph, a perfectly <i>glorious</i> triumph,&rdquo;
exclaimed the Duchess of Dreyshire, turning to Yeovil, who sat silent
among his wife&rsquo;s guests; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it just <i>glorious</i>?&rdquo;
she demanded, with a heavy insistent intonation of the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she cried, with a rising inflection,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it just <i>perfectly</i> glorious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed Yeovil; &ldquo;you see
glory hasn&rsquo;t come very much my way lately.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
before he exactly realised what he was doing, he raised his voice and
quoted loudly for the benefit of half the room:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Other Romans shall arise,<br />
Heedless of a soldier&rsquo;s name,<br />
Sounds, not deeds, shall win the prize,<br />
Harmony the path to fame.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a sort of shiver of surprised silence at Yeovil&rsquo;s
end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word rang out in a strong young voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s the worst of
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s damned true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil turned, with some dozen others, to see who was responsible
for this vigorously expressed statement.</p>
<p>Tony Luton confronted him, an angry scowl on his face, a blaze in
his heavy-lidded eyes.&nbsp; The boy was without a conscience, almost
without a soul, as priests and parsons reckon souls, but there was a
slumbering devil-god within him, and Yeovil&rsquo;s taunting words had
broken the slumber.&nbsp; Life had been for Tony a hard school, in which
right and wrong, high endeavour and good resolve, were untaught subjects;
but there was a sterling something in him, just that something that
helped poor street-scavenged men to die brave-fronted deaths in the
trenches of Salamanca, that fired a handful of apprentice boys to shut
the gates of Derry and stare unflinchingly at grim leaguer and starvation.&nbsp;
It was just that nameless something that was lacking in the young musician,
who stood at the further end of the room, bathed in a flood of compliment
and congratulation, enjoying the honey-drops of his triumph.</p>
<p>Luton pushed his way through the crowd and left the room, without
troubling to take leave of his hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange young man,&rdquo; exclaimed the Duchess; &ldquo;now
do take me into the next room,&rdquo; she went on almost in the same
breath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just dying for some iced coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil escorted her through the throng of Ronnie-worshippers to the
desired haven of refreshment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; Mrs. Menteith-Mendlesohnn was exclaiming
in ringing trumpet tones; &ldquo;of course I always knew he could play,
but this is not mere piano playing, it is tone-mastery, it is sound
magic.&nbsp; Mrs. Yeovil has introduced us to a new star in the musical
firmament.&nbsp; Do you know, I feel this afternoon just like Cortez,
in the poem, gazing at the newly discovered sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Silent upon a peak in Darien,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted
a penetrating voice that could only belong to Joan Mardle; &ldquo;I
say, can any one picture Mrs. Menteith-Mendlesohnn silent on any peak
or under any circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If any one had that measure of imagination, no one acknowledged the
fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great gift and a great responsibility,&rdquo; Canon Mousepace
was assuring the Gr&auml;fin; &ldquo;the power of evoking sublime melody
is akin to the power of awakening thought; a musician can appeal to
dormant consciousness as the preacher can appeal to dormant conscience.&nbsp;
It is a responsibility, an instrument for good or evil.&nbsp; Our young
friend here, we may be sure, will use it as an instrument for good.&nbsp;
He has, I feel certain, a sense of his responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a nice boy,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin simply; &ldquo;he
has such pretty hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of the window recesses Rhapsodie Pantril was talking vaguely
but beautifully to a small audience on the subject of chromatic chords;
she had the advantage of knowing what she was talking about, an advantage
that her listeners did not in the least share.&nbsp; &ldquo;All through
his playing there ran a tone-note of malachite green,&rdquo; she declared
recklessly, feeling safe from immediate contradiction; &ldquo;malachite
green, <i>my</i> colour&mdash;the colour of striving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having satisfied the ruling passion that demanded gentle and dextrous
self-advertisement, she realised that the Augusta Smith in her craved
refreshment, and moved with one of her over-awed admirers towards the
haven where peaches and iced coffee might be considered a certainty.</p>
<p>The refreshment alcove, which was really a good-sized room, a sort
of chapel-of-ease to the larger drawing-room, was already packed with
a crowd who felt that they could best discuss Ronnie&rsquo;s triumph
between mouthfuls of fruit salad and iced draughts of hock-cup.&nbsp;
So brief is human glory that two or three independent souls had even
now drifted from the theme of the moment on to other more personally
interesting topics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iced mulberry salad, my dear, it&rsquo;s a <i>sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;</i>
<i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>maison</i>, so to speak; they say the roving
husband brought the recipe from Astrakhan, or Seville, or some such
outlandish place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish my husband would roam about a bit and bring back strange
palatable dishes.&nbsp; No such luck, he&rsquo;s got asthma and has
to keep on a gravel soil with a south aspect and all sorts of other
restrictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re to be pitied in the least;
a husband with asthma is like a captive golf-ball, you can always put
your hand on him when you want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the hangings, <i>violette</i> <i>de</i> <i>Parme</i>,
all the furniture, rosewood.&nbsp; Nothing is to be played in it except
Mozart.&nbsp; Mozart only.&nbsp; Some of my friends wanted me to have
a replica of the Mozart statue at Vienna put up in a corner of the room,
with flowers always around it, but I really couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>.&nbsp; One is <i>so</i> tired of it, one sees
it everywhere.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m like that,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve secured the hero of the hour, Ronnie Storre,
oh yes, rather.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to join our yachting trip, third
week of August.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going as far afield as Fiume, in the
Adriatic&mdash;or is it the &AElig;gean?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it be jolly.&nbsp;
Oh no, we&rsquo;re not asking Mrs. Yeovil; it&rsquo;s quite a small
yacht you know&mdash;at least, it&rsquo;s a small party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excellent von Tolb took her departure, bearing off with her the
Landgraf, who had already settled the date and duration of Ronnie&rsquo;s
Christmas visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be dull, you know,&rdquo; he warned the prospective
guest; &ldquo;our Landtag will not be sitting, and what is a bear-garden
without the bears?&nbsp; However, we haf some wildt schwein in our woods,
we can show you some sport in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronnie instantly saw himself in a well-fitting shooting costume,
with a Tyrolese hat placed at a very careful angle on his head, but
he confessed that the other details of boar-hunting were rather beyond
him.</p>
<p>With the departure of the von Tolb party Canon Mousepace gravitated
decently but persistently towards a corner where the Duchess, still
at concert pitch, was alternatively praising Ronnie&rsquo;s performance
and the mulberry salad.&nbsp; Joan Mardle, who formed one of the group,
was not openly praising any one, but she was paying a silent tribute
to the salad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just talking about Ronnie Storre&rsquo;s music, Canon,&rdquo;
said the Duchess; &ldquo;I consider it just perfectly glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great talent, isn&rsquo;t it, Canon,&rdquo; put
in Joan briskly, &ldquo;and of course it&rsquo;s a responsibility as
well, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp; Music can be such an influence, just
as eloquence can; don&rsquo;t you agree with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quarry of the English language was of course a public property,
but it was disconcerting to have one&rsquo;s own particular barrow-load
of sentence-building material carried off before one&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
The Canon&rsquo;s impressive homily on Ronnie&rsquo;s gift and its possibilities
had to be hastily whittled down to a weakly acquiescent, &ldquo;Quite
so, quite so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tasted this iced mulberry salad, Canon?&rdquo; asked
the Duchess; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s perfectly luscious.&nbsp; Just hurry
along and get some before it&rsquo;s all gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And her Grace hurried along in an opposite direction, to thank Cicely
for past favours and to express lively gratitude for the Tuesday to
come.</p>
<p>The guests departed, with a rather irritating slowness, for which
perhaps the excellence of Cicely&rsquo;s buffet arrangements was partly
responsible.&nbsp; The great drawing-room seemed to grow larger and
more oppressive as the human wave receded, and the hostess fled at last
with some relief to the narrower limits of her writing-room and the
sedative influences of a cigarette.&nbsp; She was inclined to be sorry
for herself; the triumph of the afternoon had turned out much as she
had predicted at lunch time.&nbsp; Her idol of onyx had not been swept
from its pedestal, but the pedestal itself had an air of being packed
up ready for transport to some other temple.&nbsp; Ronnie would be flattered
and spoiled by half a hundred people, just because he could conjure
sounds out of a keyboard, and Cicely felt no great incentive to go on
flattering and spoiling him herself.&nbsp; And Ronnie would acquiesce
in his dismissal with the good grace born of indifference&mdash;the
surest guarantor of perfect manners.&nbsp; Already he had social engagements
for the coming months in which she had no share; the drifting apart
would be mutual.&nbsp; He had been an intelligent and amusing companion,
and he had played the game as she had wished it to be played, without
the fatigue of keeping up pretences which neither of them could have
believed in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us have a wonderfully good time together&rdquo;
had been the single stipulation in their unwritten treaty of comradeship,
and they had had the good time.&nbsp; Their whole-hearted pursuit of
material happiness would go on as keenly as before, but they would hunt
in different company, that was all.&nbsp; Yes, that was all. . . .</p>
<p>Cicely found the effect of her cigarette less sedative than she was
disposed to exact.&nbsp; It might be necessary to change the brand.&nbsp;
Some ten or eleven days later Yeovil read an announcement in the papers
that, in spite of handsome offers of increased salary, Mr. Tony Luton,
the original singer of the popular ditty &ldquo;Eccleston Square,&rdquo;
had terminated his engagement with Messrs. Isaac Grosvenor and Leon
Hebhardt of the Caravansery Theatre, and signed on as a deck hand in
the Canadian Marine.</p>
<p>Perhaps after all there had been some shred of glory amid the trumpet
triumph of that July afternoon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV: THE INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATOR OF WANTS</h2>
<p>Two of Yeovil&rsquo;s London clubs, the two that he had been accustomed
to frequent, had closed their doors after the catastrophe.&nbsp; One
of them had perished from off the face of the earth, its fittings had
been sold and its papers lay stored in some solicitor&rsquo;s office,
a tit-bit of material for the pen of some future historian.&nbsp; The
other had transplanted itself to Delhi, whither it had removed its early
Georgian furniture and its traditions, and sought to reproduce its St.
James&rsquo;s Street atmosphere as nearly as the conditions of a tropical
Asiatic city would permit.&nbsp; There remained the Cartwheel, a considerably
newer institution, which had sprung into existence somewhere about the
time of Yeovil&rsquo;s last sojourn in England; he had joined it on
the solicitation of a friend who was interested in the venture, and
his bankers had paid his subscription during his absence.&nbsp; As he
had never been inside its doors there could be no depressing comparisons
to make between its present state and aforetime glories, and Yeovil
turned into its portals one afternoon with the adventurous detachment
of a man who breaks new ground and challenges new experiences.</p>
<p>He entered with a diffident sense of intrusion, conscious that his
standing as a member might not be recognised by the keepers of the doors;
in a moment, however, he realised that a rajah&rsquo;s escort of elephants
might almost have marched through the entrance hall and vestibule without
challenge.&nbsp; The general atmosphere of the scene suggested a blend
of the railway station at Cologne, the Hotel Bristol in any European
capital, and the second act in most musical comedies.&nbsp; A score
of brilliant and brilliantined pages decorated the foreground, while
Hebraic-looking gentlemen, wearing tartan waistcoats of the clans of
their adoption, flitted restlessly between the tape machines and telephone
boxes.&nbsp; The army of occupation had obviously established a firm
footing in the hospitable premises; a kaleidoscopic pattern of uniforms,
sky-blue, indigo, and bottle-green, relieved the civilian attire of
the groups that clustered in lounge and card rooms and corridors.&nbsp;
Yeovil rapidly came to the conclusion that the joys of membership were
not for him.&nbsp; He had turned to go, after a very cursory inspection
of the premises and their human occupants, when he was hailed by a young
man, dressed with strenuous neatness, whom he remembered having met
in past days at the houses of one or two common friends.</p>
<p>Hubert Herlton&rsquo;s parents had brought him into the world, and
some twenty-one years later had put him into a motor business.&nbsp;
Having taken these pardonable liberties they had completely exhausted
their ideas of what to do with him, and Hubert seemed unlikely to develop
any ideas of his own on the subject.&nbsp; The motor business elected
to conduct itself without his connivance; journalism, the stage, tomato
culture (without capital), and other professions that could be entered
on at short notice were submitted to his consideration by nimble-minded
relations and friends.&nbsp; He listened to their suggestions with polite
indifference, being rude only to a cousin who demonstrated how he might
achieve a settled income of from two hundred to a thousand pounds a
year by the propagation of mushrooms in a London basement.&nbsp; While
his walk in life was still an undetermined promenade his parents died,
leaving him with a carefully-invested income of thirty-seven pounds
a year.&nbsp; At that point of his career Yeovil&rsquo;s knowledge of
him stopped short; the journey to Siberia had taken him beyond the range
of Herlton&rsquo;s domestic vicissitudes.</p>
<p>The young man greeted him in a decidedly friendly manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were a member here,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever been in the club,&rdquo;
said Yeovil, &ldquo;and I fancy it will be the last.&nbsp; There is
rather too much of the fighting machine in evidence here.&nbsp; One
doesn&rsquo;t want a perpetual reminder of what has happened staring
one in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried at first to keep the alien element out,&rdquo; said
Herlton apologetically, &ldquo;but we couldn&rsquo;t have carried on
the club if we&rsquo;d stuck to that line.&nbsp; You see we&rsquo;d
lost more than two-thirds of our old members so we couldn&rsquo;t afford
to be exclusive.&nbsp; As a matter of fact the whole thing was decided
over our heads; a new syndicate took over the concern, and a new committee
was installed, with a good many foreigners on it.&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s
horrid having these uniforms flaunting all over the place, but what
is one to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil said nothing, with the air of a man who could have said a
great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you wonder, why remain a member under those conditions?&rdquo;
continued Herlton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, as far as I am concerned, a place
like this is a necessity for me.&nbsp; In fact, it&rsquo;s my profession,
my source of income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you as good at bridge as all that?&rdquo; asked Yeovil;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fairly successful player myself, but I should be
sorry to have to live on my winnings, year in, year out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play cards,&rdquo; said Herlton, &ldquo;at least
not for serious stakes.&nbsp; My winnings or losings wouldn&rsquo;t
come to a tenner in an average year.&nbsp; No, I live by commissions,
by introducing likely buyers to would-be sellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sellers of what?&rdquo; asked Yeovil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything, everything; horses, yachts, old masters, plate,
shootings, poultry-farms, week-end cottages, motor cars, almost anything
you can think of.&nbsp; Look,&rdquo; and he produced from his breast
pocket a bulky note-book illusorily inscribed &ldquo;engagements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he explained, tapping the book, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a double entry of every likely client that I know, with a note of
the things he may have to sell and the things he may want to buy.&nbsp;
When it is something that he has for sale there are cross-references
to likely purchasers of that particular line of article.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
limit myself to things that I actually know people to be in want of,
I go further than that and have theories, carefully indexed theories,
as to the things that people might want to buy.&nbsp; At the right moment,
if I can get the opportunity, I mention the article that is in my mind&rsquo;s
eye to the possible purchaser who has also been in my mind&rsquo;s eye,
and I frequently bring off a sale.&nbsp; I started a chance acquaintance
on a career of print-buying the other day merely by telling him of a
couple of good prints that I knew of, that were to be had at a quite
reasonable price; he is a man with more money than he knows what to
do with, and he has laid out quite a lot on old prints since his first
purchase.&nbsp; Most of his collection he has got through me, and of
course I net a commission on each transaction.&nbsp; So you see, old
man, how useful, not to say necessary, a club with a large membership
is to me.&nbsp; The more mixed and socially chaotic it is, the more
serviceable it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;and I suppose, as a
matter of fact, a good many of your clients belong to the conquering
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, they are the people who have got the money,&rdquo;
said Herlton; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the invading Germans
are usually people of wealth, but while they live over here they escape
the crushing taxation that falls on the British-born subject.&nbsp;
They serve their country as soldiers, and we have to serve it in garrison
money, ship money and so forth, besides the ordinary taxes of the State.&nbsp;
The German shoulders the rifle, the Englishman has to shoulder everything
else.&nbsp; That is what will help more than anything towards the gradual
Germanising of our big towns; the comparatively lightly-taxed German
workman over here will have a much bigger spending power and purchasing
power than his heavily taxed English neighbour.&nbsp; The public-houses,
bars, eating-houses, places of amusement and so forth, will come to
cater more and more for money-yielding German patronage.&nbsp; The stream
of British emigration will swell rather than diminish, and the stream
of Teuton immigration will be equally persistent and progressive.&nbsp;
Yes, the military-service ordinance was a cunning stroke on the part
of that old fox, von Kwarl.&nbsp; As a civilian statesman he is far
and away cleverer than Bismarck was; he smothers with a feather-bed
where Bismarck would have tried to smash with a sledge-hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got me down on your list of noteworthy people?&rdquo;
asked Yeovil, turning the drift of the conversation back to the personal
topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I have,&rdquo; said Herlton, turning the pages of
his pocket directory to the letter Y.&nbsp; &ldquo;As soon as I knew
you were back in England I made several entries concerning you.&nbsp;
In the first place it was possible that you might have a volume on Siberian
travel and natural history notes to publish, and I&rsquo;ve cross-referenced
you to a publisher I know who rather wants books of that sort on his
list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may tell you at once that I&rsquo;ve no intentions in that
direction,&rdquo; said Yeovil, in some amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; said Herlton cheerfully, scribbling a
hieroglyphic in his book; &ldquo;that branch of business is rather outside
my line&mdash;too little in it, and the gratitude of author and publisher
for being introduced to one another is usually short-lived.&nbsp; A
more serious entry was the item that if you were wintering in England
you would be looking out for a hunter or two.&nbsp; You used to hunt
with the East Wessex, I remember; I&rsquo;ve got just the very animal
that will suit that country, ready waiting for you.&nbsp; A beautiful
clean jumper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve put it over a fence or two myself, and
you and I ride much the same weight.&nbsp; A stiffish price is being
asked for it, but I&rsquo;ve got the letters D.O. after your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Yeovil, now openly grinning,
&ldquo;before I die of curiosity tell me what D.O. stands for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means some one who doesn&rsquo;t object to pay a good price
for anything that really suits him.&nbsp; There are some people of course
who won&rsquo;t consider a thing unless they can get it for about a
third of what they imagine to be its market value.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
got another suggestion down against you in my book; you may not be staying
in the country at all, you may be clearing out in disgust at existing
conditions.&nbsp; In that case you would be selling a lot of things
that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to cart away with you.&nbsp; That involves
another set of entries and a whole lot of cross references.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve given you a lot of trouble,&rdquo;
said Yeovil drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Herlton, &ldquo;but it would simplify
matters if we take it for granted that you are going to stay here, for
this winter anyhow, and are looking out for hunters.&nbsp; Can you lunch
with me here on Wednesday, and come and look at the animal afterwards?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only thirty-five minutes by train.&nbsp; It will take us
longer if we motor.&nbsp; There is a two-fifty-three from Charing Cross
that we could catch comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to persuade me to hunt in the East Wessex
country this season,&rdquo; said Yeovil, &ldquo;you must find me a convenient
hunting box somewhere down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i> found it,&rdquo; said Herlton, whipping out
a stylograph, and hastily scribbling an &ldquo;order to view&rdquo;
on a card; &ldquo;central as possible for all the meets, grand stabling
accommodation, excellent water-supply, big bathroom, game larder, cellarage,
a bakehouse if you want to bake your own bread&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any land with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough to be a nuisance.&nbsp; An acre or two of paddock
and about the same of garden.&nbsp; You are fond of wild things; a wood
comes down to the edge of the garden, a wood that harbours owls and
buzzards and kestrels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got all those details in your book?&rdquo; asked
Yeovil; &ldquo;&lsquo;wood adjoining property, O.B.K.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep those details in my head,&rdquo; said Herlton, &ldquo;but
they are quite reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall insist on something substantial off the rent if there
are no buzzards,&rdquo; said Yeovil; &ldquo;now that you have mentioned
them they seem an indispensable accessory to any decent hunting-box.&nbsp;
Look,&rdquo; he exclaimed, catching sight of a plump middle-aged individual,
crossing the vestibule with an air of restrained importance, &ldquo;there
goes the delectable Pitherby.&nbsp; Does he come on your books at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say!&rdquo; exclaimed Herlton fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
delectable P. nourishes expectations of a barony or viscounty at an
early date.&nbsp; Most of his life has been spent in streets and squares,
with occasional migrations to the esplanades of fashionable watering-places
or the gravelled walks of country house gardens.&nbsp; Now that <i>noblesse</i>
is about to impose its obligations on him, quite a new catalogue of
wants has sprung into his mind.&nbsp; There are things that a plain
esquire may leave undone without causing scandalised remark, but a fiercer
light beats on a baron.&nbsp; Trigger-pulling is one of the obligations.&nbsp;
Up to the present Pitherby has never hit a partridge in anger, but this
year he has commissioned me to rent him a deer forest.&nbsp; Some pedigree
Herefords for his &lsquo;home farm&rsquo; was another commission, and
a dozen and a half swans for a swannery.&nbsp; The swannery, I may say,
was my idea; I said once in his hearing that it gave a baronial air
to an estate; you see I knew a man who had got a lot of surplus swan
stock for sale.&nbsp; Now Pitherby wants a heronry as well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
put him in communication with a client of mine who suffers from superfluous
herons, but of course I can&rsquo;t guarantee that the birds&rsquo;
nesting arrangements will fall in with his territorial requirement.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m getting him some carp, too, of quite respectable age, for
a carp pond; I thought it would look so well for his lady-wife to be
discovered by interviewers feeding the carp with her own fair hands,
and I put the same idea into Pitherby&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea that so many things were necessary to endorse
a patent of nobility,&rdquo; said Yeovil.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there should
be any miscarriage in the bestowal of the honour at least Pitherby will
have absolved himself from any charge of contributory negligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we say Wednesday, here, one o&rsquo;clock, lunch first,
and go down and look at the horse afterwards?&rdquo; said Herlton, returning
to the matter in hand.</p>
<p>Yeovil hesitated, then he nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no harm in going to look at the animal,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI: SUNRISE</h2>
<p>Mrs. Kerrick sat at a little teak-wood table in the verandah of a
low-pitched teak-built house that stood on the steep slope of a brown
hillside.&nbsp; Her youngest child, with the grave natural dignity of
nine-year old girlhood, maintained a correct but observant silence,
looking carefully yet unobtrusively after the wants of the one guest,
and checking from time to time the incursions of ubiquitous ants that
were obstinately disposed to treat the table-cloth as a foraging ground.&nbsp;
The wayfaring visitor, who was experiencing a British blend of Eastern
hospitality, was a French naturalist, travelling thus far afield in
quest of feathered specimens to enrich the aviaries of a bird-collecting
Balkan King.&nbsp; On the previous evening, while shrugging his shoulders
and unloosing his vocabulary over the meagre accommodation afforded
by the native rest-house, he had been enchanted by receiving an invitation
to transfer his quarters to the house on the hillside, where he found
not only a pleasant-voiced hostess and some drinkable wine, but three
brown-skinned English youngsters who were able to give him a mass of
intelligent first-hand information about the bird life of the region.&nbsp;
And now, at the early morning breakfast, ere yet the sun was showing
over the rim of the brown-baked hills, he was learning something of
the life of the little community he had chanced on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
in these parts many years ago,&rdquo; explained the hostess, &ldquo;when
my husband was alive and had an appointment out here.&nbsp; It is a
healthy hill district and I had pleasant memories of the place, so when
it became necessary, well, desirable let us say, to leave our English
home and find a new one, it occurred to me to bring my boys and my little
girl here&mdash;my eldest girl is at school in Paris.&nbsp; Labour is
cheap here and I try my hand at farming in a small way.&nbsp; Of course
it is very different work to just superintending the dairy and poultry-yard
arrangements of an English country estate.&nbsp; There are so many things,
insect ravages, bird depredations, and so on, that one only knows on
a small scale in England, that happen here in wholesale fashion, not
to mention droughts and torrential rains and other tropical visitations.&nbsp;
And then the domestic animals are so disconcertingly different from
the ones one has been used to; humped cattle never seem to behave in
the way that straight-backed cattle would, and goats and geese and chickens
are not a bit the same here that they are in Europe&mdash;and of course
the farm servants are utterly unlike the same class in England.&nbsp;
One has to unlearn a good deal of what one thought one knew about stock-keeping
and agriculture, and take note of the native ways of doing things; they
are primitive and unenterprising of course, but they have an accumulated
store of experience behind them, and one has to tread warily in initiating
improvements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman looked round at the brown sun-scorched hills, with
the dusty empty road showing here and there in the middle distance and
other brown sun-scorched hills rounding off the scene; he looked at
the lizards on the verandah walls, at the jars for keeping the water
cool, at the numberless little insect-bored holes in the furniture,
at the heat-drawn lines on his hostess&rsquo;s comely face.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
his present wanderings he had a Frenchman&rsquo;s strong homing instinct,
and he marvelled to hear this lady, who should have been a lively and
popular figure in the social circle of some English county town, talking
serenely of the ways of humped cattle and native servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your children, how do they like the change?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is healthy up here among the hills,&rdquo; said the mother,
also looking round at the landscape and thinking doubtless of a very
different scene; &ldquo;they have an outdoor life and plenty of liberty.&nbsp;
They have their ponies to ride, and there is a lake up above us that
is a fine place for them to bathe and boat in; the three boys are there
now, having their morning swim.&nbsp; The eldest is sixteen and he is
allowed to have a gun, and there is some good wild fowl shooting to
be had in the reed beds at the further end of the lake.&nbsp; I think
that part of the joy of his shooting expeditions lies in the fact that
many of the duck and plover that he comes across belong to the same
species that frequent our English moors and rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first hint that she had given of a wistful sense of exile,
the yearning for other skies, the message that a dead bird&rsquo;s plumage
could bring across rolling seas and scorching plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the education of your boys, how do you manage for that?&rdquo;
asked the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a young tutor living out in these wilds,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Kerrick; &ldquo;he was assistant master at a private school in
Scotland, but it had to be given up when&mdash;when things changed;
so many of the boys left the country.&nbsp; He came out to an uncle
who has a small estate eight miles from here, and three days in the
week he rides over to teach my boys, and three days he goes to another
family living in the opposite direction.&nbsp; To-day he is due to come
here.&nbsp; It is a great boon to have such an opportunity for getting
the boys educated, and of course it helps him to earn a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the society of the place?&rdquo; asked the Frenchman.</p>
<p>His hostess laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must admit it has to be looked for with a strong pair of
field-glasses,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is almost as difficult to
get a good bridge four together as it would have been to get up a tennis
tournament or a subscription dance in our particular corner of England.&nbsp;
One has to ignore distances and forget fatigue if one wants to be gregarious
even on a limited scale.&nbsp; There are one or two officials who are
our chief social mainstays, but the difficulty is to muster the few
available souls under the same roof at the same moment.&nbsp; A road
will be impassable in one quarter, a pony will be lame in another, a
stress of work will prevent some one else from coming, and another may
be down with a touch of fever.&nbsp; When my little girl gave a birthday
party here her only little girl guest had come twelve miles to attend
it.&nbsp; The Forest officer happened to drop in on us that evening,
so we felt quite festive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman&rsquo;s eyes grew round in wonder.&nbsp; He had once
thought that the capital city of a Balkan kingdom was the uttermost
limit of social desolation, viewed from a Parisian standpoint, and there
at any rate one could get <i>caf&eacute;</i> <i>chantant</i>, tennis,
picnic parties, an occasional theatre performance by a foreign troupe,
now and then a travelling circus, not to speak of Court and diplomatic
functions of a more or less sociable character.&nbsp; Here, it seemed,
one went a day&rsquo;s journey to reach an evening&rsquo;s entertainment,
and the chance arrival of a tired official took on the nature of a festivity.&nbsp;
He looked round again at the rolling stretches of brown hills; before
he had regarded them merely as the background to this little shut-away
world, now he saw that they were foreground as well.&nbsp; They were
everything, there was nothing else.&nbsp; And again his glance travelled
to the face of his hostess, with its bright, pleasant eyes and smiling
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you live here with your children,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here
in this wilderness?&nbsp; You leave England, you leave everything, for
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hostess rose and took him over to the far side of the verandah.&nbsp;
The beginnings of a garden were spread out before them, with young fruit
trees and flowering shrubs, and bushes of pale pink roses.&nbsp; Exuberant
tropical growths were interspersed with carefully tended vestiges of
plants that had evidently been brought from a more temperate climate,
and had not borne the transition well.&nbsp; Bushes and trees and shrubs
spread away for some distance, to where the ground rose in a small hillock
and then fell away abruptly into bare hillside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all this garden that you see,&rdquo; said the Englishwoman,
&ldquo;there is one tree that is sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tree?&rdquo; said the Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tree that we could not grow in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman followed the direction of her eyes and saw a tall,
bare pole at the summit of the hillock.&nbsp; At the same moment the
sun came over the hilltops in a deep, orange glow, and a new light stole
like magic over the brown landscape.&nbsp; And, as if they had timed
their arrival to that exact moment of sunburst, three brown-faced boys
appeared under the straight, bare pole.&nbsp; A cord shivered and flapped,
and something ran swiftly up into the air, and swung out in the breeze
that blew across the hills&mdash;a blue flag with red and white crosses.&nbsp;
The three boys bared their heads and the small girl on the verandah
steps stood rigidly to attention.&nbsp; Far away down the hill, a young
man, cantering into view round a corner of the dusty road, removed his
hat in loyal salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why we live out here,&rdquo; said the Englishwoman
quietly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII: THE EVENT OF THE SEASON</h2>
<p>In the first swelter room of the new Osmanli Baths in Cork Street
four or five recumbent individuals, in a state of moist nudity and self-respecting
inertia, were smoking cigarettes or making occasional pretence of reading
damp newspapers.&nbsp; A glass wall with a glass door shut them off
from the yet more torrid regions of the further swelter chambers; another
glass partition disclosed the dimly-lit vault where other patrons of
the establishment had arrived at the stage of being pounded and kneaded
and sluiced by Oriental-looking attendants.&nbsp; The splashing and
trickling of taps, the flip-flap of wet slippers on a wet floor, and
the low murmur of conversation, filtered through glass doors, made an
appropriately drowsy accompaniment to the scene.</p>
<p>A new-comer fluttered into the room, beamed at one of the occupants,
and settled himself with an air of elaborate languor in a long canvas
chair.&nbsp; Cornelian Valpy was a fair young man, with perpetual surprise
impinged on his countenance, and a chin that seemed to have retired
from competition with the rest of his features.&nbsp; The beam of recognition
that he had given to his friend or acquaintance subsided into a subdued
but lingering simper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; drawled his neighbour lazily, dropping
the end of a cigarette into a small bowl of water, and helping himself
from a silver case on the table at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; said Cornelian, opening wide a pair of eyes
in which unhealthy intelligence seemed to struggle in undetermined battle
with utter vacuity; &ldquo;why should you suppose that anything is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you wear a look of idiotic complacency in a Turkish bath,&rdquo;
said the other, &ldquo;it is the more noticeable from the fact that
you are wearing nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you at the Shalem House dance last night?&rdquo; asked
Cornelian, by way of explaining his air of complacent retrospection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but I feel as if I had been;
I&rsquo;ve been reading columns about it in the <i>Dawn</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last event of the season,&rdquo; said Cornelian, &ldquo;and
quite one of the most amusing and lively functions that there have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the <i>Dawn</i> said; but then, as Shalem practically owns
and controls that paper, its favourable opinion might be taken for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole idea of the Revel was quite original,&rdquo; said
Cornelian, who was not going to have his personal narrative of the event
forestalled by anything that a newspaper reporter might have given to
the public; &ldquo;a certain number of guests went as famous personages
in the world&rsquo;s history, and each one was accompanied by another
guest typifying the prevailing characteristic of that personage.&nbsp;
One man went as Julius C&aelig;sar, for instance, and had a girl typifying
ambition as his shadow, another went as Louis the Eleventh, and his
companion personified superstition.&nbsp; Your shadow had to be someone
of the opposite sex, you see, and every alternate dance throughout the
evening you danced with your shadow-partner.&nbsp; Quite a clever idea;
young Graf von Schnatelstein is supposed to have invented it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York will be deeply beholden to him,&rdquo; said the other;
&ldquo;shadow-dances, with all manner of eccentric variations, will
be the rage there for the next eighteen months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the costumes were really sumptuous,&rdquo; continued
Cornelian; &ldquo;the Duchess of Dreyshire was magnificent as Aholibah,
you never saw so many jewels on one person, only of course she didn&rsquo;t
look dark enough for the character; she had Billy Carnset for her shadow,
representing Unspeakable Depravity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth did he manage that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a blend of Beardsley and Bakst as far as get-up and costume,
and of course his own personality counted for a good deal.&nbsp; Quite
one of the successes of the evening was Leutnant von Gabelroth, as George
Washington, with Joan Mardle as his shadow, typifying Inconvenient Candour.&nbsp;
He put her down officially as Truthfulness, but every one had heard
the other version.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for the Gabelroth, though he does belong to the invading
Horde; it&rsquo;s not often that any one scores off Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another blaze of magnificence was the loud-voiced Bessimer
woman, as the Goddess Juno, with peacock tails and opals all over her;
she had Ronnie Storre to represent Green-eyed Jealousy.&nbsp; Talking
of Ronnie Storre <i>and</i> of jealousy, you will naturally wonder whom
Mrs. Yeovil went with.&nbsp; I forget what her costume was, but she&rsquo;d
got that dark-headed youth with her that she&rsquo;s been trotting round
everywhere the last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelian&rsquo;s neighbour kicked him furtively on the shin, and
frowned in the direction of a dark-haired youth reclining in an adjacent
chair.&nbsp; The youth in question rose from his seat and stalked into
the further swelter room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So clever of him to go into the furnace room,&rdquo; said
the unabashed Cornelian; &ldquo;now if he turns scarlet all over we
shall never know how much is embarrassment and how much is due to the
process of being boiled.&nbsp; La Yeovil hasn&rsquo;t done badly by
the exchange; he&rsquo;s better looking than Ronnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that Pitherby went as Frederick the Great,&rdquo; said
Cornelian&rsquo;s neighbour, fingering a sheet of the <i>Dawn</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that exactly what one would have expected Pitherby
to do?&rdquo; said Cornelian.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so desperately
anxious to announce to all whom it may concern that he has written a
life of that hero.&nbsp; He had an uninspiring-looking woman with him,
supposed to represent Military Genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of Advertisement would have been more appropriate,&rdquo;
said the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opening scene of the Revel was rather effective,&rdquo;
continued Cornelian; &ldquo;all the Shadow people reclined in the dimly-lit
centre of the ballroom in an indistinguishable mass, and the human characters
marched round the illuminated sides of the room to solemn processional
music.&nbsp; Every now and then a shadow would detach itself from the
mass, hail its partner by name, and glide out to join him or her in
the procession.&nbsp; Then, when the last shadows had found their mates
and every one was partnered, the lights were turned up in a blaze, the
orchestra crashed out a whirl of nondescript dance music, and people
just let themselves go.&nbsp; It was Pandemonium.&nbsp; Afterwards every
one strutted about for half an hour or so, showing themselves off, and
then the legitimate programme of dances began.&nbsp; There were some
rather amusing incidents throughout the evening.&nbsp; One set of lancers
was danced entirely by the Seven Deadly Sins and their human exemplars;
of course seven couples were not sufficient to make up the set, so they
had to bring in an eighth sin, I forget what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sin of Patriotism would have been rather appropriate,
considering who were giving the dance,&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Cornelian nervously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know who may overhear you in a place like this.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
get yourself into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there some rather daring new dance of the &lsquo;bunny-hug&rsquo;
variety?&rdquo; asked the indiscreet one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Cubby-Cuddle,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Cornelian; &ldquo;three
or four adventurous couples danced it towards the end of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Dawn</i> says that without being strikingly new it
was strikingly modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best description I can give of it,&rdquo; said Cornelian,
&ldquo;is summed up in the comment of the Gr&auml;fin von Tolb when
she saw it being danced: &lsquo;if they <i>really</i> love each other
I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo;&nbsp; By the way,&rdquo; he
added with apparent indifference, &ldquo;is there any detailed account
of my costume in the <i>Dawn</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion laughed cynically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you hadn&rsquo;t read everything that the <i>Dawn</i>
and the other morning papers have to say about the ball hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The naked truth should be avoided in a Turkish bath,&rdquo;
said Cornelian; &ldquo;kindly assume that I&rsquo;ve only had time to
glance at the weather forecast and the news from China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;your costume
isn&rsquo;t described; you simply come amid a host of others as &lsquo;Mr.
Cornelian Valpy, resplendent as the Emperor Nero; with him Miss Kate
Lerra, typifying Insensate Vanity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many hard things have
been said of Nero, but his unkindest critics have never accused him
of resembling you in feature.&nbsp; Until some very clear evidence is
produced I shall refuse to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornelian was proof against these shafts; leaning back gracefully
in his chair he launched forth into that detailed description of his
last night&rsquo;s attire which the Dawn had so unaccountably failed
to supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wore a tunic of white Nepaulese silk, with a collar of pearls,
real pearls.&nbsp; Round my waist I had a girdle of twisted serpents
in beaten gold, studded all over with amethysts.&nbsp; My sandals were
of gold, laced with scarlet thread, and I had seven bracelets of gold
on each arm.&nbsp; Round my head I had a wreath of golden laurel leaves
set with scarlet berries, and hanging over my left shoulder was a silk
robe of mulberry purple, broidered with the signs of the zodiac in gold
and scarlet; I had it made specially for the occasion.&nbsp; At my side
I had an ivory-sheathed dagger, with a green jade handle, hung in a
green Cordova leather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point of the recital his companion rose softly, flung his
cigarette end into the little water-bowl, and passed into the further
swelter room.&nbsp; Cornelian Valpy was left, still clothed in a look
of ineffable complacency, still engaged, in all probability, in reclothing
himself in the finery of the previous evening.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII: THE DEAD WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND</h2>
<p>The pale light of a November afternoon faded rapidly into the dusk
of a November evening.&nbsp; Far over the countryside housewives put
up their cottage shutters, lit their lamps, and made the customary remark
that the days were drawing in.&nbsp; In barn yards and poultry-runs
the greediest pullets made a final tour of inspection, picking up the
stray remaining morsels of the evening meal, and then, with much scrambling
and squawking, sought the places on the roosting-pole that they thought
should belong to them.&nbsp; Labourers working in yard and field began
to turn their thoughts homeward or tavernward as the case might be.&nbsp;
And through the cold squelching slush of a water-logged meadow a weary,
bedraggled, but unbeaten fox stiffly picked his way, climbed a high
bramble-grown bank, and flung himself into the sheltering labyrinth
of a stretching tangle of woods.&nbsp; The pack of fierce-mouthed things
that had rattled him from copse and gorse-cover, along fallow and plough,
hedgerow and wooded lane, for nigh on an hour, and had pressed hard
on his life for the last few minutes, receded suddenly into the background
of his experiences.&nbsp; The cold, wet meadow, the thick mask of woods,
and the oncoming dusk had stayed the chase&mdash;and the fox had outstayed
it.&nbsp; In a short time he would fall mechanically to licking off
some of the mud that caked on his weary pads; in a shorter time horsemen
and hounds would have drawn off kennelward and homeward.</p>
<p>Yeovil rode through the deepening twilight, relying chiefly on his
horse to find its way in the network of hedge-bordered lanes that presumably
led to a high road or to some human habitation.&nbsp; He was desperately
tired after his day&rsquo;s hunting, a legacy of weakness that the fever
had bequeathed to him, but even though he could scarcely sit upright
in his saddle his mind dwelt complacently on the day&rsquo;s sport and
looked forward to the snug cheery comfort that awaited him at his hunting
box.&nbsp; There was a charm, too, even for a tired man, in the eerie
stillness of the lone twilight land through which he was passing, a
grey shadow-hung land which seemed to have been emptied of all things
that belonged to the daytime, and filled with a lurking, moving life
of which one knew nothing beyond the sense that it was there.&nbsp;
There, and very near.&nbsp; If there had been wood-gods and wicked-eyed
fauns in the sunlit groves and hill sides of old Hellas, surely there
were watchful, living things of kindred mould in this dusk-hidden wilderness
of field and hedge and coppice.</p>
<p>It was Yeovil&rsquo;s third or fourth day with the hounds, without
taking into account a couple of mornings&rsquo; cub-hunting.&nbsp; Already
he felt that he had been doing nothing different from this all his life.&nbsp;
His foreign travels, his illness, his recent weeks in London, they were
part of a tapestried background that had very slight and distant connection
with his present existence.&nbsp; Of the future he tried to think with
greater energy and determination.&nbsp; For this winter, at any rate,
he would hunt and do a little shooting, entertain a few of his neighbours
and make friends with any congenial fellow-sportsmen who might be within
reach.&nbsp; Next year things would be different; he would have had
time to look round him, to regain something of his aforetime vigour
of mind and body.&nbsp; Next year, when the hunting season was over,
he would set about finding out whether there was any nobler game for
him to take a hand in.&nbsp; He would enter into correspondence with
old friends who had gone out into the tropics and the backwoods&mdash;he
would do something.</p>
<p>So he told himself, but he knew thoroughly well that he had found
his level.&nbsp; He had ceased to struggle against the fascination of
his present surroundings.&nbsp; The slow, quiet comfort and interest
of country life appealed with enervating force to the man whom death
had half conquered.&nbsp; The pleasures of the chase, well-provided
for in every detail, and dovetailed in with the assured luxury of a
well-ordered, well-staffed establishment, were exactly what he wanted
and exactly what his life down here afforded him.&nbsp; He was experiencing,
too, that passionate recurring devotion to an old loved scene that comes
at times to men who have travelled far and willingly up and down the
world.&nbsp; He was very much at home.&nbsp; The alien standard floating
over Buckingham Palace, the Crown of Charlemagne on public buildings
and official documents, the grey ships of war riding in Plymouth Bay
and Southampton Water with a flag at their stern that older generations
of Britons had never looked on, these things seemed far away and inconsequent
amid the hedgerows and woods and fallows of the East Wessex country.&nbsp;
Horse and hound-craft, harvest, game broods, the planting and felling
of timber, the rearing and selling of stock, the letting of grasslands,
the care of fisheries, the up-keep of markets and fairs, they were the
things that immediately mattered.&nbsp; And Yeovil saw himself, in moments
of disgust and self-accusation, settling down into this life of rustic
littleness, concerned over the late nesting of a partridge or the defective
draining of a loose-box, hugely busy over affairs that a gardener&rsquo;s
boy might grapple with, ignoring the struggle-cry that went up, low
and bitter and wistful, from a dethroned dispossessed race, in whose
glories he had gloried, in whose struggle he lent no hand.&nbsp; In
what way, he asked himself in such moments, would his life be better
than the life of that parody of manhood who upholstered his rooms with
art hangings and rosewood furniture and babbled over the effect?</p>
<p>The lanes seemed interminable and without aim or object except to
bisect one another; gates and gaps disclosed nothing in the way of a
landmark, and the night began to draw down in increasing shades of darkness.&nbsp;
Presently, however, the tired horse quickened its pace, swung round
a sharp corner into a broader roadway, and stopped with an air of thankful
expectancy at the low doorway of a wayside inn.&nbsp; A cheerful glow
of light streamed from the windows and door, and a brighter glare came
from the other side of the road, where a large motorcar was being got
ready for an immediate start.&nbsp; Yeovil tumbled stiffly out of his
saddle, and in answer to the loud rattle of his hunting crop on the
open door the innkeeper and two or three hangers-on hurried out to attend
to the wants of man and beast.&nbsp; Flour and water for the horse and
something hot for himself were Yeovil&rsquo;s first concern, and then
he began to clamour for geographical information.&nbsp; He was rather
dismayed to find that the cumulative opinions of those whom he consulted,
and of several others who joined unbidden in the discussion, placed
his destination at nothing nearer than nine miles.&nbsp; Nine miles
of dark and hilly country road for a tired man on a tired horse assumed
enormous, far-stretching proportions, and although he dimly remembered
that he had asked a guest to dinner for that evening he began to wonder
whether the wayside inn possessed anything endurable in the way of a
bedroom.&nbsp; The landlord interrupted his desperate speculations with
a really brilliant effort of suggestion.&nbsp; There was a gentleman
in the bar, he said, who was going in a motorcar in the direction for
which Yeovil was bound, and who would no doubt be willing to drop him
at his destination; the gentleman had also been out with the hounds.&nbsp;
Yeovil&rsquo;s horse could be stabled at the inn and fetched home by
a groom the next morning.&nbsp; A hurried embassy to the bar parlour
resulted in the news that the motorist would be delighted to be of assistance
to a fellow-sportsman.&nbsp; Yeovil gratefully accepted the chance that
had so obligingly come his way, and hastened to superintend the housing
of his horse in its night&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp; When he had duly seen
to the tired animal&rsquo;s comfort and foddering he returned to the
roadway, where a young man in hunting garb and a livened chauffeur were
standing by the side of the waiting car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so very pleased to be of some use to you, Mr. Yeovil,&rdquo;
said the car-owner, with a polite bow, and Yeovil recognised the young
Leutnant von Gabelroth, who had been present at the musical afternoon
at Berkshire Street.&nbsp; He had doubtless seen him at the meet that
morning, but in his hunting kit he had escaped his observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, have been out with the hounds,&rdquo; the young man
continued; &ldquo;I have left my horse at the Crow and Sceptre at Dolford.&nbsp;
You are living at Black Dene, are you not?&nbsp; I can take you right
past your door, it is all on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeovil hung back for a moment, overwhelmed with vexation and embarrassment,
but it was too late to cancel the arrangement he had unwittingly entered
into, and he was constrained to put himself under obligation to the
young officer with the best grace he could muster.&nbsp; After all,
he reflected, he had met him under his own roof as his wife&rsquo;s
guest.&nbsp; He paid his reckoning to mine host, tipped the stable lad
who had helped him with his horse, and took his place beside von Gabelroth
in the car.</p>
<p>As they glided along the dark roadway and the young German reeled
off a string of comments on the incidents of the day&rsquo;s sport,
Yeovil lay back amid his comfortable wraps and weighed the measure of
his humiliation.&nbsp; It was Cicely&rsquo;s gospel that one should
know what one wanted in life and take good care that one got what one
wanted.&nbsp; Could he apply that test of achievement to his own life?&nbsp;
Was this what he really wanted to be doing, pursuing his uneventful
way as a country squire, sharing even his sports and pastimes with men
of the nation that had conquered and enslaved his Fatherland?</p>
<p>The car slackened its pace somewhat as they went through a small
hamlet, past a schoolhouse, past a rural police-station with the new
monogram over its notice-board, past a church with a little tree-grown
graveyard.&nbsp; There, in a corner, among wild-rose bushes and tall
yews, lay some of Yeovil&rsquo;s own kinsfolk, who had lived in these
parts and hunted and found life pleasant in the days that were not so
very long ago.&nbsp; Whenever he went past that quiet little gathering-place
of the dead Yeovil was wont to raise his hat in mute affectionate salutation
to those who were now only memories in his family; to-night he somehow
omitted the salute and turned his head the other way.&nbsp; It was as
though the dead of his race saw and wondered.</p>
<p>Three or four months ago the thing he was doing would have seemed
an impossibility, now it was actually happening; he was listening to
the gay, courteous, tactful chatter of his young companion, laughing
now and then at some joking remark, answering some question of interest,
learning something of hunting ways and traditions in von Gabelroth&rsquo;s
own country.&nbsp; And when the car turned in at the gate of the hunting
lodge and drew up at the steps the laws of hospitality demanded that
Yeovil should ask his benefactor of the road to come in for a few minutes
and drink something a little better than the wayside inn had been able
to supply.&nbsp; The young officer spent the best part of a half hour
in Yeovil&rsquo;s snuggery, examining and discussing the trophies of
rifle and collecting gun that covered the walls.&nbsp; He had a good
knowledge of woodcraft, and the beasts and birds of Siberian forests
and North African deserts were to him new pages in a familiar book.&nbsp;
Yeovil found himself discoursing eagerly with his chance guest on the
European distribution and local variation of such and such a species,
recounting peculiarities in its habits and incidents of its pursuit
and capture.&nbsp; If the cold observant eyes of Lady Shalem could have
rested on the scene she would have hailed it as another root-fibre thrown
out by the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.</p>
<p>Yeovil closed the hall door on his departing visitor, and closed
his mind on the crowd of angry and accusing thoughts that were waiting
to intrude themselves.&nbsp; His valet had already got his bath in readiness
and in a few minutes the tired huntsman was forgetting weariness and
the consciousness of outside things in the languorous abandonment that
steam and hot water induce.&nbsp; Brain and limbs seemed to lay themselves
down in a contented waking sleep, the world that was beyond the bathroom
walls dropped away into a far unreal distance; only somewhere through
the steam clouds pierced a hazy consciousness that a dinner, well chosen,
was being well cooked, and would presently be well served&mdash;and
right well appreciated.&nbsp; That was the lure to drag the bather away
from the Nirvana land of warmth and steam.&nbsp; The stimulating after-effect
of the bath took its due effect, and Yeovil felt that he was now much
less tired and enormously hungry.&nbsp; A cheery fire burned in his
dressing-room and a lively black kitten helped him to dress, and incidentally
helped him to require a new tassel to the cord of his dressing-gown.&nbsp;
As he finished his toilet and the kitten finished its sixth and most
notable attack on the tassel a ring was heard at the front door, and
a moment later a loud, hearty, and unmistakably hungry voice resounded
in the hall.&nbsp; It belonged to the local doctor, who had also taken
part in the day&rsquo;s run and had been bidden to enliven the evening
meal with the entertainment of his inexhaustible store of sporting and
social reminiscences.&nbsp; He knew the countryside and the countryfolk
inside out, and he was a living unwritten chronicle of the East Wessex
hunt.&nbsp; His conversation seemed exactly the right accompaniment
to the meal; his stories brought glimpses of wet hedgerows, stiff ploughlands,
leafy spinneys and muddy brooks in among the rich old Worcester and
Georgian silver of the dinner service, the glow and crackle of the wood
fire, the pleasant succession of well-cooked dishes and mellow wines.&nbsp;
The world narrowed itself down again to a warm, drowsy-scented dining-room,
with a productive hinterland of kitchen and cellar beyond it, and beyond
that an important outer world of loose box and harness-room and stable-yard;
further again a dark hushed region where pheasants roosted and owls
flitted and foxes prowled.</p>
<p>Yeovil sat and listened to story after story of the men and women
and horses of the neighbourhood; even the foxes seemed to have a personality,
some of them, and a personal history.&nbsp; It was a little like Hans
Andersen, he decided, and a little like the <i>Reminiscences</i> <i>of</i>
<i>an</i> <i>Irish</i> <i>R</i>.<i>M</i>., and perhaps just a little
like some of the more probable adventures of Baron Munchausen.&nbsp;
The newer stories were evidently true to the smallest detail, the earlier
ones had altered somewhat in repetition, as plants and animals vary
under domestication.</p>
<p>And all the time there was one topic that was never touched on.&nbsp;
Of half the families mentioned it was necessary to add the qualifying
information that they &ldquo;used to live&rdquo; at such and such a
place; the countryside knew them no longer.&nbsp; Their properties were
for sale or had already passed into the hands of strangers.&nbsp; But
neither man cared to allude to the grinning shadow that sat at the feast
and sent an icy chill now and again through the cheeriest jest and most
jovial story.&nbsp; The brisk run with the hounds that day had stirred
and warmed their pulses; it was an evening for comfortable forgetting.&nbsp;
Later that night, in the stillness of his bedroom, with the dwindling
noises of a retiring household dropping off one by one into ordered
silence, a door shutting here, a fire being raked out there, the thoughts
that had been held away came crowding in.&nbsp; The body was tired,
but the brain was not, and Yeovil lay awake with his thoughts for company.&nbsp;
The world grew suddenly wide again, filled with the significance of
things that mattered, held by the actions of men that mattered.&nbsp;
Hunting-box and stable and gun-room dwindled to a mere pin-point in
the universe, there were other larger, more absorbing things on which
the mind dwelt.&nbsp; There was the grey cold sea outside Dover and
Portsmouth and Cork, where the great grey ships of war rocked and swung
with the tides, where the sailors sang, in doggerel English, that bitter-sounding
adaptation, &ldquo;Germania rules t&rsquo;e waves,&rdquo; where the
flag of a World-Power floated for the world to see.&nbsp; And in oven-like
cities of India there were men who looked out at the white sun-glare,
the heat-baked dust, the welter of crowded streets, who listened to
the unceasing chorus of harsh-throated crows, the strident creaking
of cart-wheels, the buzz and drone of insect swarms and the rattle call
of the tree lizards; men whose thoughts went hungrily to the cool grey
skies and wet turf and moist ploughlands of an English hunting country,
men whose memories listened yearningly to the music of a deep-throated
hound and the call of a game-bird in the stubble.&nbsp; Yeovil had secured
for himself the enjoyment of the things for which these men hungered;
he had known what he wanted in life, slowly and with hesitation, yet
nevertheless surely, he had arrived at the achievement of his unconfessed
desires.&nbsp; Here, installed under his own roof-tree, with as good
horseflesh in his stable as man could desire, with sport lying almost
at his door, with his wife ready to come down and help him to entertain
his neighbours, Murrey Yeovil had found the life that he wanted&mdash;and
was accursed in his own eyes.&nbsp; He argued with himself, and palliated
and explained, but he knew why he had turned his eyes away that evening
from the little graveyard under the trees; one cannot explain things
to the dead.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX: THE LITTLE FOXES</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil
the vines&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a warm and sunny May afternoon, some ten months since Yeovil&rsquo;s
return from his Siberian wanderings and sickness, Cicely sat at a small
table in the open-air restaurant in Hyde Park, finishing her after-luncheon
coffee and listening to the meritorious performance of the orchestra.&nbsp;
Opposite her sat Larry Meadowfield, absorbed for the moment in the slow
enjoyment of a cigarette, which also was not without its short-lived
merits.&nbsp; Larry was a well-dressed youngster, who was, in Cicely&rsquo;s
opinion, distinctly good to look on&mdash;an opinion which the boy himself
obviously shared.&nbsp; He had the healthy, well-cared-for appearance
of a country-dweller who has been turned into a town dandy without suffering
in the process.&nbsp; His blue-black hair, growing very low down on
a broad forehead, was brushed back in a smoothness that gave his head
the appearance of a rain-polished sloe; his eyebrows were two dark smudges
and his large violet-grey eyes expressed the restful good temper of
an animal whose immediate requirements have been satisfied.&nbsp; The
lunch had been an excellent one, and it was jolly to feed out of doors
in the warm spring air&mdash;the only drawback to the arrangement being
the absence of mirrors.&nbsp; However, if he could not look at himself
a great many people could look at him.</p>
<p>Cicely listened to the orchestra as it jerked and strutted through
a fantastic dance measure, and as she listened she looked appreciatively
at the boy on the other side of the table, whose soul for the moment
seemed to be in his cigarette.&nbsp; Her scheme of life, knowing just
what you wanted and taking good care that you got it, was justifying
itself by results.&nbsp; Ronnie, grown tiresome with success, had not
been difficult to replace, and no one in her world had had the satisfaction
of being able to condole with her on the undesirable experience of a
long interregnum.&nbsp; To feminine acquaintances with fewer advantages
of purse and brains and looks she might figure as &ldquo;that Yeovil
woman,&rdquo; but never had she given them justification to allude to
her as &ldquo;poor Cicely Yeovil.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Murrey, dear old
soul, had cooled down, as she had hoped and wished, from his white heat
of disgust at the things that she had prepared herself to accept philosophically.&nbsp;
A new chapter of their married life and man-and-woman friendship had
opened; many a rare gallop they had had together that winter, many a
cheery dinner gathering and long bridge evening in the cosy hunting-lodge.&nbsp;
Though he still hated the new London and held himself aloof from most
of her Town set, yet he had not shown himself rigidly intolerant of
the sprinkling of Teuton sportsmen who hunted and shot down in his part
of the country.</p>
<p>The orchestra finished its clicking and caracoling and was accorded
a short clatter of applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Danse</i> <i>Macabre</i>,&rdquo; said Cicely to her
companion; &ldquo;one of Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo; best known pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Larry indifferently; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take your word for it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Fraid I don&rsquo;t know much about
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear boy, that&rsquo;s just what I like in you,&rdquo;
said Cicely; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re such a delicious young barbarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; said Larry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare say.&nbsp; I
suppose you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s father had been a brilliantly clever man who had married
a brilliantly handsome woman; the Fates had not had the least intention
that Larry should take after both parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fashion of having one&rsquo;s lunch in the open air has
quite caught on this season,&rdquo; said Cicely; &ldquo;one sees everybody
here on a fine day.&nbsp; There is Lady Bailquist over there.&nbsp;
She used to be Lady Shalem you know, before her husband got the earldom&mdash;to
be more correct, before she got it for him.&nbsp; I suppose she is all
agog to see the great review.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in fact precisely the absorbing topic of the forthcoming Boy-Scout
march-past that was engaging the Countess of Bailquist&rsquo;s earnest
attention at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going to be an historical occasion,&rdquo; she was saying
to Sir Leonard Pitherby (whose services to literature had up to the
present received only a half-measure of recognition); &ldquo;if it miscarries
it will be a serious set-back for the <i>fait</i> <i>accompli</i>.&nbsp;
If it is a success it will be the biggest step forward in the path of
reconciliation between the two races that has yet been taken.&nbsp;
It will mean that the younger generation is on our side&mdash;not all,
of course, but some, that is all we can expect at present, and that
will be enough to work on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing the Scouts hang back and don&rsquo;t turn up in
any numbers,&rdquo; said Sir Leonard anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of course is the danger,&rdquo; said Lady Bailquist quietly;
&ldquo;probably two-thirds of the available strength will hold back,
but a third or even a sixth would be enough; it would redeem the parade
from the calamity of fiasco, and it would be a nucleus to work on for
the future.&nbsp; That is what we want, a good start, a preliminary
rally.&nbsp; It is the first step that counts, that is why to-day&rsquo;s
event is of such importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course, the first step on the road,&rdquo; assented
Sir Leonard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; continued Lady Bailquist, &ldquo;that
nothing has been left undone to rally the Scouts to the new order of
things.&nbsp; Special privileges have been showered on them, alone among
all the cadet corps they have been allowed to retain their organisation,
a decoration of merit has been instituted for them, a large hostelry
and gymnasium has been provided for them in Westminster, His Majesty&rsquo;s
youngest son is to be their Scoutmaster-in-Chief, a great athletic meeting
is to be held for them each year, with valuable prizes, three or four
hundred of them are to be taken every summer, free of charge, for a
holiday in the Bavarian Highlands and the Baltic Seaboard; besides this
the parent of every scout who obtains the medal for efficiency is to
be exempted from part of the new war taxation that the people are finding
so burdensome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One certainly cannot say that they have not had attractions
held out to them,&rdquo; said Sir Leonard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a special effort,&rdquo; said Lady Bailquist; &ldquo;it
is worth making an effort for.&nbsp; They are going to be the Janissaries
of the Empire; the younger generation knocking at the doors of progress,
and thrusting back the bars and bolts of old racial prejudices.&nbsp;
I tell you, Sir Leonard, it will be an historic moment when the first
corps of those little khaki-clad boys swings through the gates of the
Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do they come?&rdquo; asked the baronet, catching something
of his companion&rsquo;s zeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first detachment is due to arrive at three,&rdquo; said
Lady Bailquist, referring to a small time-table of the afternoon&rsquo;s
proceedings; &ldquo;three, punctually, and the others will follow in
rapid succession.&nbsp; The Emperor and Suite will arrive at two-fifty
and take up their positions at the saluting base&mdash;over there, where
the big flag-staff has been set up.&nbsp; The boys will come in by Hyde
Park Corner, the Marble Arch, and the Albert Gate, according to their
districts, and form in one big column over there, where the little flags
are pegged out.&nbsp; Then the young Prince will inspect them and lead
them past His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will be with the Imperial party?&rdquo; asked Sir Leonard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is to be an important affair; everything will be done
to emphasise the significance of the occasion,&rdquo; said Lady Bailquist,
again consulting her programme.&nbsp; &ldquo;The King of W&uuml;rtemberg,
and two of the Bavarian royal Princes, an Abyssinian Envoy who is over
here&mdash;he will lend a touch of picturesque barbarism to the scene&mdash;the
general commanding the London district and a whole lot of other military
bigwigs, and the Austrian, Italian and Roumanian military attach&eacute;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reeled off the imposing list of notables with an air of quiet
satisfaction.&nbsp; Sir Leonard made mental notes of personages to whom
he might send presentation copies of his new work &ldquo;Frederick-William,
the Great Elector, a Popular Biography,&rdquo; as a souvenir of to-day&rsquo;s
auspicious event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nearly a quarter to three now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let
us get a good position before the crowd gets thicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along to my car, it is just opposite to the saluting
base,&rdquo; said her ladyship; &ldquo;I have a police pass that will
let us through.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll ask Mrs. Yeovil and her young friend
to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry excused himself from joining the party; he had a barbarian&rsquo;s
reluctance to assisting at an Imperial triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll push off to the swimming-bath,&rdquo; he
said to Cicely; &ldquo;see you again about tea-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely walked with Lady Bailquist and the literary baronet towards
the crowd of spectators, which was steadily growing in dimensions.&nbsp;
A newsboy ran in front of them displaying a poster with the intelligence
&ldquo;Essex wickets fall rapidly&rdquo;&mdash;a semblance of county
cricket still survived under the new order of things.&nbsp; Near the
saluting base some thirty or forty motorcars were drawn up in line,
and Cicely and her companions exchanged greetings with many of the occupants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lovely day for the review, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried
the Gr&auml;fin von Tolb, breaking off her conversation with Herr Rebinok,
the little Pomeranian banker, who was sitting by her side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
haven&rsquo;t you brought young Mr. Meadowfield?&nbsp; Such a nice boy.&nbsp;
I wanted him to come and sit in my carriage and talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t talk you know,&rdquo; said Cicely; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
only brilliant to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I could have looked at him,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be thousands of other boys to look at presently,&rdquo;
said Cicely, laughing at the old woman&rsquo;s frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there will be thousands?&rdquo; asked the Gr&auml;fin,
with an anxious lowering of the voice; &ldquo;really, thousands?&nbsp;
Hundreds, perhaps; there is some uncertainty.&nbsp; Every one is not
sanguine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds, anyway,&rdquo; said Cicely.</p>
<p>The Gr&auml;fin turned to the little banker and spoke to him rapidly
and earnestly in German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most important that we should consolidate our position
in this country; we must coax the younger generation over by degrees,
we must disarm their hostility.&nbsp; We cannot afford to be always
on the watch in this quarter; it is a source of weakness, and we cannot
afford to be weak.&nbsp; This Slav upheaval in south-eastern Europe
is becoming a serious menace.&nbsp; Have you seen to-day&rsquo;s telegrams
from Agram?&nbsp; They are bad reading.&nbsp; There is no computing
the extent of this movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is directed against us,&rdquo; said the banker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin; &ldquo;it is in the nature
of things that it must be against us.&nbsp; Let us have no illusions.&nbsp;
Within the next ten years, sooner perhaps, we shall be faced with a
crisis which will be only a beginning.&nbsp; We shall need all our strength;
that is why we cannot afford to be weak over here.&nbsp; To-day is an
important day; I confess I am anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&nbsp; The kettledrums!&rdquo; exclaimed the commanding
voice of Lady Bailquist.&nbsp; &ldquo;His Majesty is coming.&nbsp; Quick,
bundle into the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd behind the police-kept lines surged expectantly into closer
formation; spectators hurried up from side-walks and stood craning their
necks above the shoulders of earlier arrivals.</p>
<p>Through the archway at Hyde Park Corner came a resplendent cavalcade,
with a swirl of colour and rhythmic movement and a crash of exultant
music; life-guards with gleaming helmets, a detachment of W&uuml;rtemberg
lancers with a flutter of black and yellow pennons, a rich medley of
staff uniforms, a prancing array of princely horsemen, the Imperial
Standard, and the King of Prussia, Great Britain, and Ireland, Emperor
of the West.&nbsp; It was the most imposing display that Londoners had
seen since the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Slowly, grandly, with thunder of music and beat of hoofs, the procession
passed through the crowd, across the sward towards the saluting base,
slowly the eagle standard, charged with the leopards, lion and harp
of the conquered kingdoms, rose mast-high on the flag-staff and fluttered
in the breeze, slowly and with military precision the troops and suite
took up their position round the central figure of the great pageant.&nbsp;
Trumpets and kettledrums suddenly ceased their music, and in a moment
there rose in their stead an eager buzz of comment from the nearest
spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well the young Prince looks in his scout uniform.&rdquo;
. . . &ldquo;The King of W&uuml;rtemberg is a much younger man than
I thought he was.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Is that a Prussian or Bavarian
uniform, there on the right, the man on a black horse?&rdquo; . . .&nbsp;
&ldquo;Neither, it&rsquo;s Austrian, the Austrian military attach&eacute;&rdquo;
. . .&nbsp; &ldquo;That is von Stoppel talking to His Majesty; he organised
the Boy Scouts in Germany, you know.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;His Majesty
is looking very pleased.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He has reason to look pleased;
this is a great event in the history of the two countries.&nbsp; It
marks a new epoch.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, do you see the Abyssinian
Envoy?&nbsp; What a picturesque figure he makes.&nbsp; How well he sits
his horse.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;That is the Grand Duke of Baden&rsquo;s
nephew, talking to the King of W&uuml;rtemberg now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the buzz and chatter of the spectators fell suddenly three sound
strokes, distant, measured, sinister; the clang of a clock striking
three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock and not a boy scout within sight or hearing!&rdquo;
exclaimed the loud ringing voice of Joan Mardle; &ldquo;one can usually
hear their drums and trumpets a couple of miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the traffic to get through,&rdquo; said Sir Leonard
Pitherby in an equally high-pitched voice; &ldquo;and of course,&rdquo;
he added vaguely, &ldquo;it takes some time to get the various units
together.&nbsp; One must give them a few minutes&rsquo; grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Bailquist said nothing, but her restless watchful eyes were
turned first to Hyde Park Corner and then in the direction of the Marble
Arch, back again to Hyde Park Corner.&nbsp; Only the dark lines of the
waiting crowd met her view, with the yellow newspaper placards flitting
in and out, announcing to an indifferent public the fate of Essex wickets.&nbsp;
As far as her searching eyes could travel the green stretch of tree
and sward remained unbroken, save by casual loiterers.&nbsp; No small
brown columns appeared, no drum beat came throbbing up from the distance.&nbsp;
The little flags pegged out to mark the positions of the awaited scout-corps
fluttered in meaningless isolation on the empty parade ground.</p>
<p>His Majesty was talking unconcernedly with one of his officers, the
foreign attach&eacute;s looked steadily between their chargers&rsquo;
ears, as though nothing in particular was hanging in the balance, the
Abyssinian Envoy displayed an untroubled serenity which was probably
genuine.&nbsp; Elsewhere among the Suite was a perceptible fidget, the
more obvious because it was elaborately cloaked.&nbsp; Among the privileged
onlookers drawn up near the saluting point the fidgeting was more unrestrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six minutes past three, and not a sign of them!&rdquo; exclaimed
Joan Mardle, with the explosive articulation of one who cannot any longer
hold back a truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said some one; &ldquo;I hear trumpets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an instant concentration of listening, a straining of eyes.</p>
<p>It was only the toot of a passing motorcar.&nbsp; Even Sir Leonard
Pitherby, with the eye of faith, could not locate as much as a cloud
of dust on the Park horizon.</p>
<p>And now another sound was heard, a sound difficult to define, without
beginning, without dimension; the growing murmur of a crowd waking to
a slowly dawning sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the band would strike up an air,&rdquo; said the Gr&auml;fin
von Tolb fretfully; &ldquo;it is stupid waiting here in silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan fingered her watch, but she made no further remark; she realised
that no amount of malicious comment could be so dramatically effective
now as the slow slipping away of the intolerable seconds.</p>
<p>The murmur from the crowd grew in volume.&nbsp; Some satirical wit
started whistling an imitation of an advancing fife and drum band; others
took it up and the air resounded with the shrill music of a phantom
army on the march.&nbsp; The mock throbbing of drum and squealing of
fife rose and fell above the packed masses of spectators, but no answering
echo came from beyond the distant trees.&nbsp; Like mushrooms in the
night a muster of uniformed police and plain clothes detectives sprang
into evidence on all sides; whatever happened there must be no disloyal
demonstration.&nbsp; The whistlers and mockers were pointedly invited
to keep silence, and one or two addresses were taken.&nbsp; Under the
trees, well at the back of the crowd, a young man stood watching the
long stretch of road along which the Scouts should come.&nbsp; Something
had drawn him there, against his will, to witness the Imperial Triumph,
to watch the writing of yet another chapter in the history of his country&rsquo;s
submission to an accepted fact.&nbsp; And now a dull flush crept into
his grey face; a look that was partly new-born hope and resurrected
pride, partly remorse and shame, burned in his eyes.&nbsp; Shame, the
choking, searing shame of self-reproach that cannot be reasoned away,
was dominant in his heart.&nbsp; <i>He</i> had laid down his arms&mdash;there
were others who had never hoisted the flag of surrender.&nbsp; He had
given up the fight and joined the ranks of the hopelessly subservient;
in thousands of English homes throughout the land there were young hearts
that had not forgotten, had not compounded, would not yield.</p>
<p>The younger generation had barred the door.</p>
<p>And in the pleasant May sunshine the Eagle standard floated and flapped,
the black and yellow pennons shifted restlessly, Emperor and Princes,
Generals and guards, sat stiffly in their saddles, and waited.</p>
<p>And waited. . . .</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
